    <h2>
      ALPHONSE DAUDET
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nominally Daudet, with the Goncourts and Zola, formed a trio representing
      Naturalism in fiction. He adopted the watchwords of that school, and by
      private friendship, no less than by a common profession of faith, was one
      of them. But the students of the future, while recognizing an obvious
      affinity between the other two, may be puzzled to find Daudet&rsquo;s name
      conjoined with theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decidedly, Daudet belonged to the Realistic School. But, above all, he was
      an impressionist. All that can be observed&mdash;the individual picture,
      scene, character&mdash;Daudet will render with wonderful accuracy, and all
      his novels, especially those written after 1870, show an increasing
      firmness of touch, limpidity of style, and wise simplicity in the use of
      the sources of pathetic emotion, such as befit the cautious Naturalist.
      Daudet wrote stories, but he had to be listened to. Feverish as his method
      of writing was&mdash;true to his Southern character he took endless pains
      to write well, revising every manuscript three times over from beginning
      to end. He wrote from the very midst of the human comedy; and it is from
      this that he seems at times to have caught the bodily warmth and the taste
      of the tears and the very ring of the laughter of men and women. In the
      earlier novels, perhaps, the transitions from episode to episode or from
      scene to scene are often abrupt, suggesting the manner of the Goncourts.
      But to Zola he forms an instructive contrast, of the same school, but not
      of the same family. Zola is methodical, Daudet spontaneous. Zola works
      with documents, Daudet from the living fact. Zola is objective, Daudet
      with equal scope and fearlessness shows more personal feeling and hence
      more delicacy. And in style also Zola is vast, architectural; Daudet
      slight, rapid, subtle, lively, suggestive. And finally, in their
      philosophy of life, Zola may inspire a hate of vice and wrong, but Daudet
      wins a love for what is good and true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alphonse Daudet was born in Nimes, Provence, May 13, 1840. His father had
      been a well-to-do silk manufacturer, but, while Alphonse was still a
      child, lost his property. Poverty compelled the son to seek the wretched
      post of usher (pion) in a school at Alais. In November, 1857, he settled
      in Paris and joined his almost equally penniless brother Ernest. The
      autobiography, &lsquo;Le Petit Chose&rsquo; (1868), gives graphic details about this
      period. His first years of literary life were those of an industrious
      Bohemian, with poetry for consolation and newspaper work for bread. He had
      secured a secretaryship with the Duc de Morny, President of the Corps
      Legislatif, and had won recognition for his short stories in the &lsquo;Figaro&rsquo;,
      when failing health compelled him to go to Algiers. Returning, he married
      toward that period a lady (Julia Allard, born 1847), whose literary talent
      comprehended, supplemented, and aided his own. After the death of the Duc
      de Morny (1865) he consecrated himself entirely to literature and
      published &lsquo;Lettres de mon Moulin&rsquo; (1868), which also made his name
      favorably known. He now turned from fiction to the drama, and it was not
      until after 1870 that he became fully conscious of his vocation as a
      novelist, perhaps through the trials of the siege of Paris and the
      humiliation of his country, which deepened his nature without souring it.
      Daudet&rsquo;s genial satire, &lsquo;Tartarin de Tarascon&rsquo;, appeared in 1872; but with
      the Parisian romance &lsquo;Fromont jeune et Risler aine&rsquo;, crowned by the
      Academy (1874), he suddenly advanced into the foremost rank of French
      novelists; it was his first great success, or, as he puts it, &ldquo;the dawn of
      his popularity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How numberless editions of this book were printed, and rights of
      translations sought from other countries, Daudet has told us with natural
      pride. The book must be read to be appreciated. &ldquo;Risler, a self-made,
      honest man, raises himself socially into a society against the corruptness
      of which he has no defence and from which he escapes only by suicide.
      Sidonie Chebe is a peculiarly French type, a vain and heartless woman;
      Delobelle, the actor, a delectable figure; the domestic simplicity of
      Desiree Delobelle and her mother quite refreshing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Success followed now after success. &lsquo;Jack (1876); Le Nabab (1877); Les
      Rois en exil (1879); Numa Roumestan (1882); L&rsquo;Evangeliste (1883); Sapho
      (1884); Tartarin sur des Alces (1886); L&rsquo;Immortel (1888); Port Tarascon
      (1890); Rose et Ninette (1892); La petite Parvisse (1895); and Soutien de
      Famille (1899)&rsquo;; such is the long list of the great life-artist. In Le
      Nabab we find obvious traces of Daudet&rsquo;s visits to Algiers and
      Corsica-Mora is the Duc de Morny. Sapho is the most concentrated of his
      novels, with never a divergence, never a break, in its development. And of
      the theme&mdash;legitimate marriage contra common-law&mdash;what need be
      said except that he handled it in a manner most acceptable to the
      aesthetic and least offensive to the moral sense?
    </p>
    <p>
      L&rsquo;Immortel is a satire springing from personal reasons; L&rsquo;Evangeliste and
      Rose et Ninette&mdash;the latter on the divorce problem&mdash;may be
      classed as clever novels; but had Daudet never written more than &lsquo;Fromont
      et Risler&rsquo;, &lsquo;Tartarin sur les Alces&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Port Tarascon&rsquo;, these would
      keep him in lasting remembrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must not omit to mention also many &lsquo;contes&rsquo; and his &lsquo;Trente ans de
      Paris (A travers ma vie et mes livres), Souvenirs d&rsquo;un Homme de lettres
      (1888), and Notes sur la Vie (1899)&rsquo;.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. A WEDDING-PARTY AT THE CAFE VEFOUR
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;Madame Chebe!&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the twentieth time that day that the good Risler had said that he
      was happy, and always with the same emotional and contented manner, in the
      same low, deep voice-the voice that is held in check by emotion and does
      not speak too loud for fear of suddenly breaking into violent tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not for the world would Risler have wept at that moment&mdash;imagine a
      newly-made husband giving way to tears in the midst of the
      wedding-festival! And yet he had a strong inclination to do so. His
      happiness stifled him, held him by the throat, prevented the words from
      coming forth. All that he could do was to murmur from time to time, with a
      slight trembling of the lips, &ldquo;I am happy; I am happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, he had reason to be happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since early morning the poor man had fancied that he was being whirled
      along in one of those magnificent dreams from which one fears lest he may
      awake suddenly with blinded eyes; but it seemed to him as if this dream
      would never end. It had begun at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and at ten
      o&rsquo;clock at night, exactly ten o&rsquo;clock by Vefour&rsquo;s clock, he was still
      dreaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      How many things had happened during that day, and how vividly he
      remembered the most trivial details.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw himself, at daybreak, striding up and down his bachelor quarters,
      delight mingled with impatience, clean-shaven, his coat on, and two pairs
      of white gloves in his pocket. Then there were the wedding-coaches, and in
      the foremost one&mdash;the one with white horses, white reins, and a
      yellow damask lining&mdash;the bride, in her finery, floated by like a
      cloud. Then the procession into the church, two by two, the white veil in
      advance, ethereal, and dazzling to behold. The organ, the verger, the
      cure&rsquo;s sermon, the tapers casting their light upon jewels and spring
      gowns, and the throng of people in the sacristy, the tiny white cloud
      swallowed up, surrounded, embraced, while the bridegroom distributed
      hand-shakes among all the leading tradesmen of Paris, who had assembled to
      do him honor. And the grand crash from the organ at the close, made more
      solemn by the fact that the church door was thrown wide open, so that the
      whole street took part in the family ceremony&mdash;the music passing
      through the vestibule at the same time with the procession&mdash;the
      exclamations of the crowd, and a burnisher in an ample lute-string apron
      remarking in a loud voice, &ldquo;The groom isn&rsquo;t handsome, but the bride&rsquo;s as
      pretty as a picture.&rdquo; That is the kind of thing that makes you proud when
      you happen to be the bridegroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the breakfast at the factory, in a workroom adorned with hangings
      and flowers; the drive in the Bois&mdash;a concession to the wishes of his
      mother-in-law, Madame Chebe, who, being the petty Parisian bourgeoise that
      she was, would not have deemed her daughter legally married without a
      drive around the lake and a visit to the Cascade. Then the return for
      dinner, as the lamps were being lighted along the boulevard, where people
      turned to look after the wedding-party, a typical well-to-do bourgeois
      wedding-party, as it drove up to the grand entrance at Vefour&rsquo;s with all
      the style the livery horses could command.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler had reached that point in his dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the worthy man, dazed with fatigue and well-being, glanced vaguely
      about that huge table of twenty-four covers, curved in the shape of a
      horseshoe at the ends, and surrounded by smiling, familiar faces, wherein
      he seemed to see his happiness reflected in every eye. The dinner was
      drawing near its close. The wave of private conversation flowed around the
      table. Faces were turned toward one another, black sleeves stole behind
      waists adorned with bunches of asclepias, a childish face laughed over a
      fruit ice, and the dessert at the level of the guests&rsquo; lips encompassed
      the cloth with animation, bright colors, and light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, yes! Risler was very happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except his brother Frantz, everybody he loved was there. First of all,
      sitting opposite him, was Sidonie&mdash;yesterday little Sidonie, to-day
      his wife. For the ceremony of dinner she had laid aside her veil; she had
      emerged from her cloud. Now, above the smooth, white silk gown, appeared a
      pretty face of a less lustrous and softer white, and the crown of
      hair-beneath that other crown so carefully bestowed&mdash;would have told
      you of a tendency to rebel against life, of little feathers fluttering for
      an opportunity to fly away. But husbands do not see such things as those.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to Sidonie and Frantz, the person whom Risler loved best in the world
      was Madame Georges Fromont, whom he called &ldquo;Madame Chorche,&rdquo; the wife of
      his partner and the daughter of the late Fromont, his former employer and
      his god. He had placed her beside him, and in his manner of speaking to
      her one could read affection and deference. She was a very young woman, of
      about the same age as Sidonie, but of a more regular, quiet and placid
      type of beauty. She talked little, being out of her element in that
      conglomerate assemblage; but she tried to appear affable.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Risler&rsquo;s other side sat Madame Chebe, the bride&rsquo;s mother, radiant and
      gorgeous in her green satin gown, which gleamed like a shield. Ever since
      the morning the good woman&rsquo;s every thought had been as brilliant as that
      robe of emblematic hue. At every moment she said to herself: &ldquo;My daughter
      is marrying Fromont Jeune and Risler Aine, of Rue des Vieilles
      Haudriettes!&rdquo; For, in her mind, it was not Risler alone whom her daughter
      took for her husband, but the whole sign of the establishment, illustrious
      in the commercial annals of Paris; and whenever she mentally announced
      that glorious event, Madame Chebe sat more erect than ever, stretching the
      silk of the bodice until it almost cracked.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a contrast to the attitude of Monsieur Chebe, who was seated at a
      short distance. In different households, as a general rule, the same
      causes produce altogether different results. That little man, with the
      high forehead of a visionary, as inflated and hollow as a ball, was as
      fierce in appearance as his wife was radiant. That was nothing unusual, by
      the way, for Monsieur Chebe was in a frenzy the whole year long. On this
      particular evening, however, he did not wear his customary woe-begone,
      lack-lustre expression, nor the full-skirted coat, with the pockets
      sticking out behind, filled to repletion with samples of oil, wine,
      truffles, or vinegar, according as he happened to be dealing in one or the
      other of those articles. His black coat, new and magnificent, made a
      fitting pendant to the green gown; but unfortunately his thoughts were of
      the color of his coat. Why had they not seated him beside the bride, as
      was his right? Why had they given his seat to young Fromont? And there was
      old Gardinois, the Fromonts&rsquo; grandfather, what business had he by
      Sidonie&rsquo;s side? Ah! that was how it was to be! Everything for the Fromonts
      and nothing for the Chebes! And yet people are amazed that there are such
      things as revolutions!
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily the little man had by his side, to vent his anger upon, his friend
      Delobelle, an old, retired actor, who listened to him with his serene and
      majestic holiday countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strangely enough, the bride herself had something of that same expression.
      On that pretty and youthful face, which happiness enlivened without making
      glad, appeared indications of some secret preoccupation; and, at times,
      the corners of her lips quivered with a smile, as if she were talking to
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that same little smile she replied to the somewhat pronounced
      pleasantries of Grandfather Gardinois, who sat by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Sidonie, on my word!&rdquo; said the good man, with a laugh. &ldquo;When I think
      that not two months ago she was talking about going into a convent. We all
      know what sort of convents such minxes as she go to! As the saying is in
      our province: The Convent of Saint Joseph, four shoes under the bed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And everybody at the table laughed heartily at the rustic jests of the old
      Berrichon peasant, whose colossal fortune filled the place of manliness,
      of education, of kindness of heart, but not of wit; for he had plenty of
      that, the rascal&mdash;more than all his bourgeois fellow-guests together.
      Among the very rare persons who inspired a sympathetic feeling in his
      breast, little Chebe, whom he had known as an urchin, appealed
      particularly to him; and she, for her part, having become rich too
      recently not to venerate wealth, talked to her right-hand neighbor with a
      very perceptible air of respect and coquetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      With her left-hand-neighbor, on the contrary, Georges Fromont, her
      husband&rsquo;s partner, she exhibited the utmost reserve. Their conversation
      was restricted to the ordinary courtesies of the table; indeed there was a
      sort of affectation of indifference between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there was that little commotion among the guests which indicates
      that they are about to rise: the rustling of silk, the moving of chairs,
      the last words of conversations, the completion of a laugh, and in that
      half-silence Madame Chebe, who had become communicative, observed in a
      very loud tone to a provincial cousin, who was gazing in an ecstasy of
      admiration at the newly made bride&rsquo;s reserved and tranquil demeanor, as
      she stood with her arm in Monsieur Gardinois&rsquo;s:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see that child, cousin&mdash;well, no one has ever been able to find
      out what her thoughts were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the whole party rose and repaired to the grand salon.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the guests invited for the ball were arriving and mingling with the
      dinner-guests, while the orchestra was tuning up, while the cavaliers,
      eyeglass in position, strutted before the impatient, white-gowned damsels,
      the bridegroom, awed by so great a throng, had taken refuge with his
      friend Planus&mdash;Sigismond Planus, cashier of the house of Fromont for
      thirty years&mdash;in that little gallery decorated with flowers and hung
      with a paper representing shrubbery and clambering vines, which forms a
      sort of background of artificial verdure to Vefour&rsquo;s gilded salons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sigismond, old friend&mdash;I am very happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Sigismond too was happy; but Risler did not give him time to say so.
      Now that he was no longer in dread of weeping before his guests, all the
      joy in his heart overflowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just think of it, my friend!&mdash;It&rsquo;s so extraordinary that a young
      girl like Sidonie would consent to marry me. For you know I&rsquo;m not
      handsome. I didn&rsquo;t need to have that impudent creature tell me so this
      morning to know it. And then I&rsquo;m forty-two&mdash;and she such a dear
      little thing! There were so many others she might have chosen, among the
      youngest and the richest, to say nothing of my poor Frantz, who loved her
      so. But, no, she preferred her old Risler. And it came about so strangely.
      For a long time I noticed that she was sad, greatly changed. I felt sure
      there was some disappointment in love at the bottom of it. Her mother and
      I looked about, and we cudgelled our brains to find out what it could be.
      One morning Madame Chebe came into my room weeping, and said, &lsquo;You are the
      man she loves, my dear friend!&rsquo;&mdash;And I was the man&mdash;I was the
      man! Bless my soul! Whoever would have suspected such a thing? And to
      think that in the same year I had those two great pieces of good fortune&mdash;a
      partnership in the house of Fromont and married to Sidonie&mdash;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, to the strains of a giddy, languishing waltz, a couple
      whirled into the small salon. They were Risler&rsquo;s bride and his partner,
      Georges Fromont. Equally young and attractive, they were talking in
      undertones, confining their words within the narrow circle of the waltz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; said Sidonie, slightly pale, but with the same little smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the other, paler than she, replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not lie. It was my uncle who insisted upon this marriage. He was
      dying&mdash;you had gone away. I dared not say no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Risler, at a distance, gazed at them in admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How pretty she is! How well they dance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, when they spied him, the dancers separated, and Sidonie walked
      quickly to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! You here? What are you doing? They are looking everywhere for you.
      Why aren&rsquo;t you in there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke she retied his cravat with a pretty, impatient gesture. That
      enchanted Risler, who smiled at Sigismond from the corner of his eye, too
      overjoyed at feeling the touch of that little gloved hand on his neck, to
      notice that she was trembling to the ends of her slender fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your arm,&rdquo; she said to him, and they returned together to the
      salons. The white bridal gown with its long train made the badly cut,
      awkwardly worn black coat appear even more uncouth; but a coat can not be
      retied like a cravat; she must needs take it as it was. As they passed
      along, returning the salutations of all the guests who were so eager to
      smile upon them, Sidonie had a momentary thrill of pride, of satisfied
      vanity. Unhappily it did not last. In a corner of the room sat a young and
      attractive woman whom nobody invited to dance, but who looked on at the
      dances with a placid eye, illumined by all the joy of a first maternity.
      As soon as he saw her, Risler walked straight to the corner where she sat
      and compelled Sidonie to sit beside her. Needless to say that it was
      Madame &ldquo;Chorche.&rdquo; To whom else would he have spoken with such affectionate
      respect? In what other hand than hers could he have placed his little
      Sidonie&rsquo;s, saying: &ldquo;You will love her dearly, won&rsquo;t you? You are so good.
      She needs your advice, your knowledge of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my dear Risler,&rdquo; Madame Georges replied, &ldquo;Sidonie and I are old
      friends. We have reason to be fond of each other still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And her calm, straightforward glance strove unsuccessfully to meet that of
      her old friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his ignorance of women, and his habit of treating Sidonie as a child,
      Risler continued in the same tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take her for your model, little one. There are not two people in the
      world like Madame Chorche. She has her poor father&rsquo;s heart. A true
      Fromont!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sidonie, with her eyes cast down, bowed without replying, while an
      imperceptible shudder ran from the tip of her satin shoe to the topmost
      bit of orange-blossom in her crown. But honest Risler saw nothing. The
      excitement, the dancing, the music, the flowers, the lights made him
      drunk, made him mad. He believed that every one breathed the same
      atmosphere of bliss beyond compare which enveloped him. He had no
      perception of the rivalries, the petty hatreds that met and passed one
      another above all those bejewelled foreheads.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not notice Delobelle, standing with his elbow on the mantel, one
      hand in the armhole of his waistcoat and his hat upon his hip, weary of
      his eternal attitudinizing, while the hours slipped by and no one thought
      of utilizing his talents. He did not notice M. Chebe, who was prowling
      darkly between the two doors, more incensed than ever against the
      Fromonts. Oh! those Fromonts!&mdash;How large a place they filled at that
      wedding! They were all there with their wives, their children, their
      friends, their friends&rsquo; friends. One would have said that one of
      themselves was being married. Who had a word to say of the Rislers or the
      Chebes? Why, he&mdash;he, the father, had not even been presented!&mdash;And
      the little man&rsquo;s rage was redoubled by the attitude of Madame Chebe,
      smiling maternally upon one and all in her scarab-hued dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, there were at this, as at almost all wedding-parties, two
      distinct currents which came together but without mingling. One of the two
      soon gave place to the other. The Fromonts, who irritated Monsieur Chebe
      so much and who formed the aristocracy of the ball, the president of the
      Chamber of Commerce, the syndic of the solicitors, a famous
      chocolate-manufacturer and member of the Corps Legislatif, and the old
      millionaire Gardinois, all retired shortly after midnight. Georges Fromont
      and his wife entered their carriage behind them. Only the Risler and Chebe
      party remained, and the festivity at once changed its aspect, becoming
      more uproarious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The illustrious Delobelle, disgusted to see that no one called upon him
      for anything, decided to call upon himself for something, and began in a
      voice as resonant as a gong the monologue from Ruy Blas: &ldquo;Good appetite,
      Messieurs!&rdquo; while the guests thronged to the buffet, spread with chocolate
      and glasses of punch. Inexpensive little costumes were displayed upon the
      benches, overjoyed to produce their due effect at last; and here and there
      divers young shop-clerks, consumed with conceit, amused themselves by
      venturing upon a quadrille.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bride had long wished to take her leave. At last she disappeared with
      Risler and Madame Chebe. As for Monsieur Chebe, who had recovered all his
      importance, it was impossible to induce him to go. Some one must be there
      to do the honors, deuce take it! And I assure you that the little man
      assumed the responsibility! He was flushed, lively, frolicsome, noisy,
      almost seditious. On the floor below he could be heard talking politics
      with Vefour&rsquo;s headwaiter, and making most audacious statements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the deserted streets the wedding-carriage, the tired coachman
      holding the white reins somewhat loosely, rolled heavily toward the
      Marais.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Chebe talked continuously, enumerating all the splendors of that
      memorable day, rhapsodizing especially over the dinner, the commonplace
      menu of which had been to her the highest display of magnificence. Sidonie
      mused in the darkness of the carriage, and Risler, sitting opposite her,
      even though he no longer said, &ldquo;I am very happy,&rdquo; continued to think it
      with all his heart. Once he tried to take possession of a little white
      hand that rested against the closed window, but it was hastily withdrawn,
      and he sat there without moving, lost in mute admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove through the Halles and the Rue de Rambuteau, thronged with
      kitchen-gardeners&rsquo; wagons; and, near the end of the Rue des
      Francs-Bourgeois, they turned the corner of the Archives into the Rue de
      Braque. There they stopped first, and Madame Chebe alighted at her door,
      which was too narrow for the magnificent green silk frock, so that it
      vanished in the hall with rustlings of revolt and with all its folds
      muttering. A few minutes later, a tall, massive portal on the Rue des
      Vieilles-Haudriettes, bearing on the escutcheon that betrayed the former
      family mansion, beneath half-effaced armorial bearings, a sign in blue
      letters, Wall Papers, was thrown wide open to allow the wedding-carriage
      to pass through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the bride, hitherto motionless and like one asleep, seemed to
      wake suddenly, and if all the lights in the vast buildings, workshops or
      storehouses, which surrounded the courtyard, had not been extinguished,
      Risler might have seen that pretty, enigmatical face suddenly lighted by a
      smile of triumph. The wheels revolved less noisily on the fine gravel of a
      garden, and soon stopped before the stoop of a small house of two floors.
      It was there that the young Fromonts lived, and Risler and his wife were
      to take up their abode on the floor above. The house had an aristocratic
      air. Flourishing commerce avenged itself therein for the dismal street and
      the out-of-the-way quarter. There was a carpet on the stairway leading to
      their apartment, and on all sides shone the gleaming whiteness of marble,
      the reflection of mirrors and of polished copper.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Risler was parading his delight through all the rooms of the new
      apartment, Sidonie remained alone in her bedroom. By the light of the
      little blue lamp hanging from the ceiling, she glanced first of all at the
      mirror, which gave back her reflection from head to foot, at all her
      luxurious surroundings, so unfamiliar to her; then, instead of going to
      bed, she opened the window and stood leaning against the sill, motionless
      as a statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was clear and warm. She could see distinctly the whole factory,
      its innumerable unshaded windows, its glistening panes, its tall chimney
      losing itself in the depths of the sky, and nearer at hand the lovely
      little garden against the ancient wall of the former mansion. All about
      were gloomy, miserable roofs and squalid streets. Suddenly she started.
      Yonder, in the darkest, the ugliest of all those attics crowding so
      closely together, leaning against one another, as if overweighted with
      misery, a fifth-floor window stood wide open, showing only darkness
      within. She recognized it at once. It was the window of the landing on
      which her parents lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The window on the landing!
    </p>
    <p>
      How many things the mere name recalled! How many hours, how many days she
      had passed there, leaning on that damp sill, without rail or balcony,
      looking toward the factory. At that moment she fancied that she could see
      up yonder little Chebe&rsquo;s ragged person, and in the frame made by that poor
      window, her whole child life, her deplorable youth as a Parisian street
      arab, passed before her eyes.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. LITTLE CHEBE&rsquo;S STORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      In Paris the common landing is like an additional room, an enlargement of
      their abodes, to poor families confined in their too small apartments.
      They go there to get a breath of air in summer, and there the women talk
      and the children play.
    </p>
    <p>
      When little Chebe made too much noise in the house, her mother would say
      to her: &ldquo;There there! you bother me, go and play on the landing.&rdquo; And the
      child would go quickly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      This landing, on the upper floor of an old house in which space had not
      been spared, formed a sort of large lobby, with a high ceiling, guarded on
      the staircase side by a wrought-iron rail, lighted by a large window which
      looked out upon roofs, courtyards, and other windows, and, farther away,
      upon the garden of the Fromont factory, which was like a green oasis among
      the huge old walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing very cheerful about it, but the child liked it much
      better than her own home. Their rooms were dismal, especially when it
      rained and Ferdinand did not go out.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his brain always smoking with new ideas, which unfortunately never
      came to anything, Ferdinand Chebe was one of those slothful,
      project-devising bourgeois of when there are so many in Paris. His wife,
      whom he had dazzled at first, had soon detected his utter insignificance,
      and had ended by enduring patiently and with unchanged demeanor his
      continual dreams of wealth and the disasters that immediately followed
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the dot of eighty thousand francs which she had brought him, and which
      he had squandered in his absurd schemes, only a small annuity remained,
      which still gave them a position of some importance in the eyes of their
      neighbors, as did Madame Chebe&rsquo;s cashmere, which had been rescued from
      every wreck, her wedding laces and two diamond studs, very tiny and very
      modest, which Sidonie sometimes begged her mother to show her, as they lay
      in the drawer of the bureau, in an old-fashioned white velvet case, on
      which the jeweller&rsquo;s name, in gilt letters, thirty years old, was
      gradually fading. That was the only bit of luxury in that poor annuitant&rsquo;s
      abode.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a very long time M. Chebe had sought a place which would enable him to
      eke out their slender income. But he sought it only in what he called
      standing business, his health forbidding any occupation that required him
      to be seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed that, soon after his marriage, when he was in a flourishing
      business and had a horse and tilbury of his own, the little man had had
      one day a serious fall. That fall, to which he referred upon every
      occasion, served as an excuse for his indolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      One could not be with M. Chebe five minutes before he would say in a
      confidential tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know of the accident that happened to the Duc d&rsquo;Orleans?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then he would add, tapping his little bald pate &ldquo;The same thing
      happened to me in my youth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Since that famous fall any sort of office work made him dizzy, and he had
      found himself inexorably confined to standing business. Thus, he had been
      in turn a broker in wines, in books, in truffles, in clocks, and in many
      other things beside. Unluckily, he tired of everything, never considered
      his position sufficiently exalted for a former business man with a
      tilbury, and, by gradual degrees, by dint of deeming every sort of
      occupation beneath him, he had grown old and incapable, a genuine idler
      with low tastes, a good-for-nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Artists are often rebuked for their oddities, for the liberties they take
      with nature, for that horror of the conventional which impels them to
      follow by-paths; but who can ever describe all the absurd fancies, all the
      idiotic eccentricities with which a bourgeois without occupation can
      succeed in filling the emptiness of his life? M. Chebe imposed upon
      himself certain rules concerning his goings and comings, and his walks
      abroad. While the Boulevard Sebastopol was being built, he went twice a
      day &ldquo;to see how it was getting on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one knew better than he the fashionable shops and the bargains; and
      very often Madame Chebe, annoyed to see her husband&rsquo;s idiotic face at the
      window while she was energetically mending the family linen, would rid
      herself of him by giving him an errand to do. &ldquo;You know that place, on the
      corner of such a street, where they sell such nice cakes. They would be
      nice for our dessert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the husband would go out, saunter along the boulevard by the shops,
      wait for the omnibus, and pass half the day in procuring two cakes, worth
      three sous, which he would bring home in triumph, wiping his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Chebe adored the summer, the Sundays, the great footraces in the dust
      at Clamart or Romainville, the excitement of holidays and the crowd. He
      was one of those who went about for a whole week before the fifteenth of
      August, gazing at the black lamps and their frames, and the scaffoldings.
      Nor did his wife complain. At all events, she no longer had that chronic
      grumbler prowling around her chair for whole days, with schemes for
      gigantic enterprises, combinations that missed fire in advance,
      lamentations concerning the past, and a fixed determination not to work at
      anything to earn money.
    </p>
    <p>
      She no longer earned anything herself, poor woman; but she knew so well
      how to save, her wonderful economy made up so completely for everything
      else, that absolute want, although a near neighbor of such impecuniosity
      as theirs, never succeeded in making its way into those three rooms, which
      were always neat and clean, or in destroying the carefully mended garments
      or the old furniture so well concealed beneath its coverings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite the Chebes&rsquo; door, whose copper knob gleamed in bourgeois fashion
      upon the landing, were two other and smaller ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first, a visiting-card, held in place by four nails, according to
      the custom in vogue among industrial artists, bore the name of
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                 RISLER
             DESIGNER OF PATTERNS.
</pre>
    <p>
      On the other was a small square of leather, with these words in gilt
      letters:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
              MESDAMES DELOBELLE
          BIRDS AND INSECTS FOR ORNAMENT.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Delobelles&rsquo; door was often open, disclosing a large room with a brick
      floor, where two women, mother and daughter, the latter almost a child,
      each as weary and as pale as the other, worked at one of the thousand
      fanciful little trades which go to make up what is called the &lsquo;Articles de
      Paris&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then the fashion to ornament hats and ballgowns with the lovely
      little insects from South America that have the brilliant coloring of
      jewels and reflect the light like diamonds. The Delobelles had adopted
      that specialty.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wholesale house, to which consignments were made directly from the
      Antilles, sent to them, unopened, long, light boxes from which, when the
      lid was removed, arose a faint odor, a dust of arsenic through which
      gleamed the piles of insects, impaled before being shipped, the birds
      packed closely together, their wings held in place by a strip of thin
      paper. They must all be mounted&mdash;the insects quivering upon brass
      wire, the humming-birds with their feathers ruffled; they must be cleansed
      and polished, the beak in a bright red, claw repaired with a silk thread,
      dead eyes replaced with sparkling pearls, and the insect or the bird
      restored to an appearance of life and grace. The mother prepared the work
      under her daughter&rsquo;s direction; for Desiree, though she was still a mere
      girl, was endowed with exquisite taste, with a fairy-like power of
      invention, and no one could, insert two pearl eyes in those tiny heads or
      spread their lifeless wings so deftly as she. Happy or unhappy, Desiree
      always worked with the same energy. From dawn until well into the night
      the table was covered with work. At the last ray of daylight, when the
      factory bells were ringing in all the neighboring yards, Madame Delobelle
      lighted the lamp, and after a more than frugal repast they returned to
      their work. Those two indefatigable women had one object, one fixed idea,
      which prevented them from feeling the burden of enforced vigils. That idea
      was the dramatic renown of the illustrious Delobelle. After he had left
      the provincial theatres to pursue his profession in Paris, Delobelle
      waited for an intelligent manager, the ideal and providential manager who
      discovers geniuses, to seek him out and offer him a role suited to his
      talents. He might, perhaps, especially at the beginning, have obtained a
      passably good engagement at a theatre of the third order, but Delobelle
      did not choose to lower himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He preferred to wait, to struggle, as he said! And this is how he awaited
      the struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning in his bedroom, often in his bed, he rehearsed roles in his
      former repertory; and the Delobelle ladies trembled with emotion when they
      heard behind the partition tirades from &lsquo;Antony&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Medecin des
      Enfants&rsquo;, declaimed in a sonorous voice that blended with the
      thousand-and-one noises of the great Parisian bee-hive. Then, after
      breakfast, the actor would sally forth for the day; would go to &ldquo;do his
      boulevard,&rdquo; that is to say, to saunter to and fro between the Chateau
      d&rsquo;Eau and the Madeline, with a toothpick in the corner of his mouth, his
      hat a little on one side-always gloved, and brushed, and glossy.
    </p>
    <p>
      That question of dress was of great importance in his eyes. It was one of
      the greatest elements of success, a bait for the manager&mdash;the famous,
      intelligent manager&mdash;who never would dream of engaging a threadbare,
      shabbily dressed man.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Delobelle ladies took good care that he lacked nothing; and you can
      imagine how many birds and insects it required to fit out a blade of that
      temper! The actor thought it the most natural thing in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his view, the labors, the privations of his wife and daughter were not,
      strictly speaking, for his benefit, but for the benefit of that mysterious
      and unknown genius, whose trustee he considered himself to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a certain analogy between the position of the Chebe family and
      that of the Delobelles. But the latter household was less depressing. The
      Chebes felt that their petty annuitant existence was fastened upon them
      forever, with no prospect of amelioration, always the same; whereas, in
      the actor&rsquo;s family, hope and illusion often opened magnificent vistas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chebes were like people living in a blind alley; the Delobelles on a
      foul little street, where there was no light or air, but where a great
      boulevard might some day be laid out. And then, too, Madame Chebe no
      longer believed in her husband, whereas, by virtue of that single magic
      word, &ldquo;Art!&rdquo; her neighbor never had doubted hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet for years and years Monsieur Delobelle had been unavailingly
      drinking vermouth with dramatic agents, absinthe with leaders of claques,
      bitters with vaudevillists, dramatists, and the famous what&rsquo;s-his-name,
      author of several great dramas. Engagements did not always follow. So
      that, without once appearing on the boards, the poor man had progressed
      from jeune premier to grand premier roles, then to the financiers, then to
      the noble fathers, then to the buffoons&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped there!
    </p>
    <p>
      On two or three occasions his friends had obtained for him a chance to
      earn his living as manager of a club or a cafe as an inspector in great
      warehouses, at the &lsquo;Phares de la Bastille&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Colosse de Rhodes.&rsquo; All
      that was necessary was to have good manners. Delobelle was not lacking in
      that respect, God knows! And yet every suggestion that was made to him the
      great man met with a heroic refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no right to abandon the stage!&rdquo; he would then assert.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mouth of that poor devil, who had not set foot on the boards for
      years, it was irresistibly comical. But one lost the inclination to laugh
      when one saw his wife and his daughter swallowing particles of arsenic day
      and night, and heard them repeat emphatically as they broke their needles
      against the brass wire with which the little birds were mounted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! no! Monsieur Delobelle has no right to abandon the stage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Happy man, whose bulging eyes, always smiling condescendingly, and whose
      habit of reigning on the stage had procured for him for life that
      exceptional position of a spoiled and admired child-king! When he left the
      house, the shopkeepers on the Rue des Francs-Bourgeois, with the
      predilection of the Parisian for everything and everybody connected with
      the theatre, saluted him respectfully. He was always so well dressed! And
      then he was so kind, so obliging! When you think that every Saturday
      night, he, Ruy Blas, Antony, Raphael in the &lsquo;Filles de Maybre,&rsquo; Andres in
      the &lsquo;Pirates de la Savane,&rsquo; sallied forth, with a bandbox under his arm,
      to carry the week&rsquo;s work of his wife and daughter to a flower
      establishment on the Rue St.-Denis!
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, even when performing such a commission as that, this devil of a
      fellow had such nobility of bearing, such native dignity, that the young
      woman whose duty it was to make up the Delobelle account was sorely
      embarrassed to hand to such an irreproachable gentleman the paltry stipend
      so laboriously earned.
    </p>
    <p>
      On those evenings, by the way, the actor did not return home to dinner.
      The women were forewarned.
    </p>
    <p>
      He always met some old comrade on the boulevard, some unlucky devil like
      himself&mdash;there are so many of them in that sacred profession!&mdash;whom
      he entertained at a restaurant or cafe. Then, with scrupulous fidelity&mdash;and
      very grateful they were to him&mdash;he would carry the rest of the money
      home, sometimes with a bouquet for his wife or a little present for
      Desiree, a nothing, a mere trifle. What would you have? Those are the
      customs of the stage. It is such a simple matter in a melodrama to toss a
      handful of louis through the window!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! varlet, take this purse and hie thee hence to tell thy mistress I
      await her coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so, notwithstanding their marvellous courage, and although their trade
      was quite lucrative, the Delobelles often found themselves in straitened
      circumstances, especially in the dull season of the &lsquo;Articles de Paris.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily the excellent Risler was at hand, always ready to accommodate his
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guillaume Risler, the third tenant on the landing, lived with his brother
      Frantz, who was fifteen years his junior. The two young Swiss, tall and
      fair, strong and ruddy, brought into the dismal, hard-working house
      glimpses of the country and of health. The elder was a draughtsman at the
      Fromont factory and was paying for the education of his brother, who
      attended Chaptal&rsquo;s lectures, pending his admission to the Ecole Centrale.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his arrival at Paris, being sadly perplexed as to the installation of
      his little household, Guillaume had derived from his neighbors, Mesdames
      Chebe and Delobelle, advice and information which were an indispensable
      aid to that ingenuous, timid, somewhat heavy youth, embarrassed by his
      foreign accent and manner. After a brief period of neighborhood and mutual
      services, the Risler brothers formed a part of both families.
    </p>
    <p>
      On holidays places were always made for them at one table or the other,
      and it was a great satisfaction to the two exiles to find in those poor
      households, modest and straitened as they were, a taste of affection and
      family life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wages of the designer, who was very clever at his trade, enabled him
      to be of service to the Delobelles on rent-day, and to make his appearance
      at the Chebes&rsquo; in the guise of the rich uncle, always laden with surprises
      and presents, so that the little girl, as soon as she saw him, would
      explore his pockets and climb on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sunday he would take them all to the theatre; and almost every evening
      he would go with Messieurs Chebe and Delobelle to a brewery on the Rue
      Blondel, where he regaled them with beer and pretzels. Beer and pretzels
      were his only vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      For his own part, he knew no greater bliss than to sit before a foaming
      tankard, between his two friends, listening to their talk, and taking part
      only by a loud laugh or a shake of the head in their conversation, which
      was usually a long succession of grievances against society.
    </p>
    <p>
      A childlike shyness, and the Germanisms of speech which he never had laid
      aside in his life of absorbing toil, embarrassed him much in giving
      expression to his ideas. Moreover, his friends overawed him. They had in
      respect to him the tremendous superiority of the man who does nothing over
      the man who works; and M. Chebe, less generous than Delobelle, did not
      hesitate to make him feel it. He was very lofty with him, was M. Chebe! In
      his opinion, a man who worked, as Risler did, ten hours a day, was
      incapable, when he left his work, of expressing an intelligent idea.
      Sometimes the designer, coming home worried from the factory, would
      prepare to spend the night over some pressing work. You should have seen
      M. Chebe&rsquo;s scandalized expression then!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody could make me follow such a business!&rdquo; he would say, expanding his
      chest, and he would add, looking at Risler with the air of a physician
      making a professional call, &ldquo;Just wait till you&rsquo;ve had one severe attack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Delobelle was not so fierce, but he adopted a still loftier tone. The
      cedar does not see a rose at its foot. Delobelle did not see Risler at his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, by chance, the great man deigned to notice his presence, he had a
      certain air of stooping down to him to listen, and to smile at his words
      as at a child&rsquo;s; or else he would amuse himself by dazzling him with
      stories of actresses, would give him lessons in deportment and the
      addresses of outfitters, unable to understand why a man who earned so much
      money should always be dressed like an usher at a primary school. Honest
      Risler, convinced of his inferiority, would try to earn forgiveness by a
      multitude of little attentions, obliged to furnish all the delicacy, of
      course, as he was the constant benefactor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among these three households living on the same floor, little Chebe, with
      her goings and comings, formed the bond of union.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all times of day she would slip into the workroom of the Delobelles,
      amuse herself by watching their work and looking at all the insects, and,
      being already more coquettish than playful, if an insect had lost a wing
      in its travels, or a humming-bird its necklace of down, she would try to
      make herself a headdress of the remains, to fix that brilliant shaft of
      color among the ripples of her silky hair. It made Desiree and her mother
      smile to see her stand on tiptoe in front of the old tarnished mirror,
      with affected little shrugs and grimaces. Then, when she had had enough of
      admiring herself, the child would open the door with all the strength of
      her little fingers, and would go demurely, holding her head perfectly
      straight for fear of disarranging her headdress, and knock at the Rislers&rsquo; 
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one was there in the daytime but Frantz the student, leaning over his
      books, doing his duty faithfully. But when Sidonie enters, farewell to
      study! Everything must be put aside to receive that lovely creature with
      the humming-bird in her hair, pretending to be a princess who had come to
      Chaptal&rsquo;s school to ask his hand in marriage from the director.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was really a strange sight to see that tall, overgrown boy playing with
      that little girl of eight, humoring her caprices, adoring her as he
      yielded to her, so that later, when he fell genuinely in love with her, no
      one could have said at what time the change began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Petted as she was in those two homes, little Chebe was very fond of
      running to the window on the landing. There it was that she found her
      greatest source of entertainment, a horizon always open, a sort of vision
      of the future toward which she leaned with eager curiosity and without
      fear, for children are not subject to vertigo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the slated roofs sloping toward one another, the high wall of the
      factory, the tops of the plane-trees in the garden, the many-windowed
      workshops appeared to her like a promised land, the country of her dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Fromont establishment was to her mind the highest ideal of wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place it occupied in that part of the Marais, which was at certain
      hours enveloped by its smoke and its din, Risler&rsquo;s enthusiasm, his
      fabulous tales concerning his employer&rsquo;s wealth and goodness and
      cleverness, had aroused that childish curiosity; and such portions as she
      could see of the dwelling-houses, the carved wooden blinds, the circular
      front steps, with the garden-seats before them, a great white bird-house
      with gilt stripes glistening in the sun, the blue-lined coupe standing in
      the courtyard, were to her objects of continual admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew all the habits of the family: At what hour the bell was rung,
      when the workmen went away, the Saturday payday which kept the cashier&rsquo;s
      little lamp lighted late in the evening, and the long Sunday afternoon,
      the closed workshops, the smokeless chimney, the profound silence which
      enabled her to hear Mademoiselle Claire at play in the garden, running
      about with her cousin Georges. From Risler she obtained details.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show me the salon windows,&rdquo; she would say to him, &ldquo;and Claire&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Risler, delighted by this extraordinary interest in his beloved factory,
      would explain to the child from their lofty position the arrangement of
      the buildings, point out the print-shop, the gilding-shop, the
      designing-room where he worked, the engine-room, above which towered that
      enormous chimney blackening all the neighboring walls with its corrosive
      smoke, and which never suspected that a young life, concealed beneath a
      neighboring roof, mingled its inmost thoughts with its loud, indefatigable
      panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last one day Sidonie entered that paradise of which she had heretofore
      caught only a glimpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Fromont, to whom Risler often spoke of her little neighbor&rsquo;s beauty
      and intelligence, asked him to bring her to the children&rsquo;s ball she
      intended to give at Christmas. At first Monsieur Chebe replied by a curt
      refusal. Even in those days, the Fromonts, whose name was always on
      Rider&rsquo;s lips, irritated and humiliated him by their wealth. Moreover, it
      was to be a fancy ball, and M. Chebe&mdash;who did not sell wallpapers,
      not he!&mdash;could not afford to dress his daughter as a circus-dancer.
      But Risler insisted, declared that he would get everything himself, and at
      once set about designing a costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a memorable evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Madame Chebe&rsquo;s bedroom, littered with pieces of cloth and pins and
      small toilet articles, Desiree Delobelle superintended Sidonie&rsquo;s toilet.
      The child, appearing taller because of her short skirt of red flannel with
      black stripes, stood before the mirror, erect and motionless, in the
      glittering splendor of her costume. She was charming. The waist, with
      bands of velvet laced over the white stomacher, the lovely, long tresses
      of chestnut hair escaping from a hat of plaited straw, all the trivial
      details of her Savoyard&rsquo;s costume were heightened by the intelligent
      features of the child, who was quite at her ease in the brilliant colors
      of that theatrical garb.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole assembled neighborhood uttered cries of admiration. While some
      one went in search of Delobelle, the lame girl arranged the folds of the
      skirt, the bows on the shoes, and cast a final glance over her work,
      without laying aside her needle; she, too, was excited, poor child! by the
      intoxication of that festivity to which she was not invited. The great man
      arrived. He made Sidonie rehearse two or three stately curtseys which he
      had taught her, the proper way to walk, to stand, to smile with her mouth
      slightly open, and the exact position of the little finger. It was truly
      amusing to see the precision with which the child went through the drill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has dramatic blood in her veins!&rdquo; exclaimed the old actor
      enthusiastically, unable to understand why that stupid Frantz was strongly
      inclined to weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year after that happy evening Sidonie could have told you what flowers
      there were in the reception rooms, the color of the furniture, and the
      music they were playing as she entered the ballroom, so deep an impression
      did her enjoyment make upon her. She forgot nothing, neither the costumes
      that made an eddying whirl about her, nor the childish laughter, nor all
      the tiny steps that glided over the polished floors. For a moment, as she
      sat on the edge of a great red-silk couch, taking from the plate presented
      to her the first sherbet of her life, she suddenly thought of the dark
      stairway, of her parents&rsquo; stuffy little rooms, and it produced upon her
      mind the effect of a distant country which she had left forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, she was considered a fascinating little creature, and was much
      admired and petted. Claire Fromont, a miniature Cauchoise dressed in lace,
      presented her to her cousin Georges, a magnificent hussar who turned at
      every step to observe the effect of his sabre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand, Georges, she is my friend. She is coming to play with us
      Sundays. Mamma says she may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, with the artless impulsiveness of a happy child, she kissed little
      Chebe with all her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the time came to go. For a long time, in the filthy street where the
      snow was melting, in the dark hall, in the silent room where her mother
      awaited her, the brilliant light of the salons continued to shine before
      her dazzled eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it very fine? Did you have a charming time?&rdquo; queried Madame Chebe in
      a low tone, unfastening the buckles of the gorgeous costume, one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Sidonie, overcome with fatigue, made no reply, but fell asleep
      standing, beginning a lovely dream which was to last throughout her youth
      and cost her many tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire Fromont kept her word. Sidonie often went to play in the beautiful
      gravelled garden, and was able to see at close range the carved blinds and
      the dovecot with its threads of gold. She came to know all the corners and
      hiding-places in the great factory, and took part in many glorious games
      of hide-and-seek behind the printing-tables in the solitude of Sunday
      afternoon. On holidays a plate was laid for her at the children&rsquo;s table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody loved her, although she never exhibited much affection for any
      one. So long as she was in the midst of that luxury, she was conscious of
      softer impulses, she was happy and felt that she was embellished by her
      surroundings; but when she returned to her parents, when she saw the
      factory through the dirty panes of the window on the landing, she had an
      inexplicable feeling of regret and anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet Claire Fromont treated her as a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes they took her to the Bois, to the Tuileries, in the famous
      blue-lined carriage, or into the country, to pass a whole week at
      Grandfather Gardinois&rsquo;s chateau, at Savigny-sur-Orge. Thanks to the
      munificence of Risler, who was very proud of his little one&rsquo;s success, she
      was always presentable and well dressed. Madame Chebe made it a point of
      honor, and the pretty, lame girl was always at hand to place her treasures
      of unused coquetry at her little friend&rsquo;s service.
    </p>
    <p>
      But M. Chebe, who was always hostile to the Fromonts, looked frowningly
      upon this growing intimacy. The true reason was that he himself never was
      invited; but he gave other reasons, and would say to his wife:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that your daughter&rsquo;s heart is sad when she returns from
      that house, and that she passes whole hours dreaming at the window?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But poor Madame Chebe, who had been so unhappy ever since her marriage,
      had become reckless. She declared that one should make the most of the
      present for fear of the future, should seize happiness as it passes, as
      one often has no other support and consolation in life than the memory of
      a happy childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      For once it happened that M. Chebe was right.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. THE FALSE PEARLS
    </h2>
    <p>
      After two or three years of intimacy with Claire, of sharing her
      amusements, years during which Sidonie acquired the familiarity with
      luxury and the graceful manners of the children of the wealthy, the
      friendship was suddenly broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cousin Georges, whose guardian M. Fromont was, had entered college some
      time before. Claire in her turn took her departure for the convent with
      the outfit of a little queen; and at that very time the Chebes were
      discussing the question of apprenticing Sidonie to some trade. They
      promised to love each other as before and to meet twice a month, on the
      Sundays that Claire was permitted to go home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, little Chebe did still go down sometimes to play with her friends;
      but as she grew older she realized more fully the distance that separated
      them, and her clothes began to seem to her very simple for Madame
      Fromont&rsquo;s salon.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the three were alone, the childish friendship which made them equals
      prevented any feeling of embarrassment; but visitors came, girl friends
      from the convent, among others a tall girl, always richly dressed, whom
      her mother&rsquo;s maid used to bring to play with the little Fromonts on
      Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she saw her coming up the steps, resplendent and disdainful,
      Sidonie longed to go away at once. The other embarrassed her with awkward
      questions. Where did she live? What did her parents do? Had she a
      carriage?
    </p>
    <p>
      As she listened to their talk of the convent and their friends, Sidonie
      felt that they lived in a different world, a thousand miles from her own;
      and a deathly sadness seized her, especially when, on her return home, her
      mother spoke of sending her as an apprentice to Mademoiselle Le Mire, a
      friend of the Delobelles, who conducted a large false-pearl establishment
      on the Rue du Roi-Dore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler insisted upon the plan of having the little one serve an
      apprenticeship. &ldquo;Let her learn a trade,&rdquo; said the honest fellow. &ldquo;Later I
      will undertake to set her up in business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, this same Mademoiselle Le Mire spoke of retiring in a few years.
      It was an excellent opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, a dull day in November, her father took her to the Rue du
      Rio-Dore, to the fourth floor of an old house, even older and blacker than
      her own home.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the ground floor, at the entrance to the hall, hung a number of signs
      with gilt letters: Depot for Travelling-Bags, Plated Chains, Children&rsquo;s
      Toys, Mathematical Instruments in Glass, Bouquets for Brides and Maids of
      Honor, Wild Flowers a Specialty; and above was a little dusty show-case,
      wherein pearls, yellow with age, glass grapes and cherries surrounded the
      pretentious name of Angelina Le Mire.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a horrible house!
    </p>
    <p>
      It had not even a broad landing like that of the Chebes, grimy with old
      age, but brightened by its window and the beautiful prospect presented by
      the factory. A narrow staircase, a narrow door, a succession of rooms with
      brick floors, all small and cold, and in the last an old maid with a false
      front and black thread mitts, reading a soiled copy of the &lsquo;Journal pour
      Tous,&rsquo; and apparently very much annoyed to be disturbed in her reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Le Mire (written in two words) received the father and
      daughter without rising, discoursed at great length of the rank she had
      lost, of her father, an old nobleman of Le Rouergue&mdash;it is most
      extraordinary how many old noblemen Le Rouergue has produced!&mdash;and of
      an unfaithful steward who had carried off their whole fortune. She
      instantly aroused the sympathies of M. Chebe, for whom decayed gentlefolk
      had an irresistible charm, and he went away overjoyed, promising his
      daughter to call for her at seven o&rsquo;clock at night in accordance with the
      terms agreed upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apprentice was at once ushered into the still empty workroom.
      Mademoiselle Le Mire seated her in front of a great drawer filled with
      pearls, needles, and bodkins, with instalments of four-sou novels thrown
      in at random among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Sidonie&rsquo;s business to sort the pearls and string them in necklaces
      of equal length, which were tied together to be sold to the small dealers.
      Then the young women would soon be there and they would show her exactly
      what she would have to do, for Mademoiselle Le Mire (always written in two
      words!) did not interfere at all, but overlooked her business from a
      considerable distance, from that dark room where she passed her life
      reading newspaper novels.
    </p>
    <p>
      At nine o&rsquo;clock the work-women arrived, five tall, pale-faced, faded
      girls, wretchedly dressed, but with their hair becomingly arranged, after
      the fashion of poor working-girls who go about bare-headed through the
      streets of Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three were yawning and rubbing their eyes, saying that they were
      dead with sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they went to work beside a long table where each had her own
      drawer and her own tools. An order had been received for mourning jewels,
      and haste was essential. Sidonie, whom the forewoman instructed in her
      task in a tone of infinite superiority, began dismally to sort a multitude
      of black pearls, bits of glass, and wisps of crape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others, paying no attention to the little girl, chatted together as
      they worked. They talked of a wedding that was to take place that very day
      at St. Gervais.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we go,&rdquo; said a stout, red-haired girl, whose name was Malvina.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s to be at noon. We shall have time to go and get back again if we
      hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, at the lunch hour, the whole party rushed downstairs four steps at a
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidonie had brought her luncheon in a little basket, like a school-girl;
      with a heavy heart she sat at a corner of the table and ate alone for the
      first time in her life. Great God! what a sad and wretched thing life
      seemed to be; what a terrible revenge she would take hereafter for her
      sufferings there!
    </p>
    <p>
      At one o&rsquo;clock the girls trooped noisily back, highly excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see the white satin gown? And the veil of point d&rsquo;Angleterre?
      There&rsquo;s a lucky girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon they repeated in the workroom the remarks they had made in
      undertones in the church, leaning against the rail, throughout the
      ceremony. That question of a wealthy marriage, of beautiful clothes,
      lasted all day long; nor did it interfere with their work-far from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      These small Parisian industries, which have to do with the most trivial
      details of the toilet, keep the work-girls informed as to the fashions and
      fill their minds with thoughts of luxury and elegance. To the poor girls
      who worked on Mademoiselle Le Mire&rsquo;s fourth floor, the blackened walls,
      the narrow street did not exist. They were always thinking of something
      else and passed their lives asking one another:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Malvina, if you were rich what would you do? For my part, I&rsquo;d live on the
      Champs-Elysees.&rdquo; And the great trees in the square, the carriages that
      wheeled about there, coquettishly slackening their pace, appeared
      momentarily before their minds, a delicious, refreshing vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Chebe, in her corner, listened without speaking, industriously
      stringing her black grapes with the precocious dexterity and taste she had
      acquired in Desiree&rsquo;s neighborhood. So that in the evening, when M. Chebe
      came to fetch his daughter, they praised her in the highest terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter all her days were alike. The next day, instead of black pearls,
      she strung white pearls and bits of false coral; for at Mademoiselle Le
      Mire&rsquo;s they worked only in what was false, in tinsel, and that was where
      little Chebe was to serve her apprenticeship to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time the new apprentice-being younger and better bred than the
      others&mdash;found that they held aloof from her. Later, as she grew
      older, she was admitted to their friendship and their confidence, but
      without ever sharing their pleasures. She was too proud to go to see
      weddings at midday; and when she heard them talking of a ball at Vauxhall
      or the &lsquo;Delices du Marais,&rsquo; or of a nice little supper at Bonvalet&rsquo;s or at
      the &lsquo;Quatre Sergents de la Rochelle,&rsquo; she was always very disdainful.
    </p>
    <p>
      We looked higher than that, did we not, little Chebe?
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, her father called for her every evening. Sometimes, however,
      about the New Year, she was obliged to work late with the others, in order
      to complete pressing orders. In the gaslight those pale-faced Parisians,
      sorting pearls as white as themselves, of a dead, unwholesome whiteness,
      were a painful spectacle. There was the same fictitious glitter, the same
      fragility of spurious jewels. They talked of nothing but masked balls and
      theatres.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen Adele Page, in &lsquo;Les Trois Mousquetaires?&rsquo; And Melingue? And
      Marie Laurent? Oh! Marie Laurent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The actors&rsquo; doublets, the embroidered costumes of the queens of melodrama,
      appeared before them in the white light of the necklaces forming beneath
      their fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summer the work was less pressing. It was the dull season. In the
      intense heat, when through the drawn blinds fruit-sellers could be heard
      in the street, crying their mirabelles and Queen Claudes, the workgirls
      slept heavily, their heads on the table. Or perhaps Malvina would go and
      ask Mademoiselle Le Mire for a copy of the &lsquo;Journal pour Tous,&rsquo; and read
      aloud to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      But little Chebe did not care for the novels. She carried one in her head
      much more interesting than all that trash.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is, nothing could make her forget the factory. When she set forth
      in the morning on her father&rsquo;s arm, she always cast a glance in that
      direction. At that hour the works were just stirring, the chimney emitted
      its first puff of black smoke. Sidonie, as she passed, could hear the
      shouts of the workmen, the dull, heavy blows of the bars of the
      printing-press, the mighty, rhythmical hum of the machinery; and all those
      sounds of toil, blended in her memory with recollections of fetes and
      blue-lined carriages, haunted her persistently.
    </p>
    <p>
      They spoke louder than the rattle of the omnibuses, the street cries, the
      cascades in the gutters; and even in the workroom, when she was sorting
      the false pearls even at night, in her own home, when she went, after
      dinner, to breathe the fresh air at the window on the landing and to gaze
      at the dark, deserted factory, that murmur still buzzed in her ears,
      forming, as it were, a continual accompaniment to her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little one is tired, Madame Chebe. She needs diversion. Next Sunday I
      will take you all into the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These Sunday excursions, which honest Risler organized to amuse Sidonie,
      served only to sadden her still more.
    </p>
    <p>
      On those days she must rise at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning; for the poor
      must pay for all their enjoyments, and there was always a ribbon to be
      ironed at the last moment, or a bit of trimming to be sewn on in an
      attempt to rejuvenate the everlasting little lilac frock with white
      stripes which Madame Chebe conscientiously lengthened every year.
    </p>
    <p>
      They would all set off together, the Chebes, the Rislers, and the
      illustrious Delobelle. Only Desiree and her mother never were of the
      party. The poor, crippled child, ashamed of her deformity, never would
      stir from her chair, and Mamma Delobelle stayed behind to keep her
      company. Moreover, neither possessed a suitable gown in which to show
      herself out-of-doors in their great man&rsquo;s company; it would have destroyed
      the whole effect of his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they left the house, Sidonie would brighten up a little. Paris in the
      pink haze of a July morning, the railway stations filled with light
      dresses, the country flying past the car windows, and the healthful
      exercise, the bath in the pure air saturated with the water of the Seine,
      vivified by a bit of forest, perfumed by flowering meadows, by ripening
      grain, all combined to make her giddy for a moment. But that sensation was
      soon succeeded by disgust at such a commonplace way of passing her Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was always the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stopped at a refreshment booth, in close proximity to a very noisy
      and numerously attended rustic festival, for there must be an audience for
      Delobelle, who would saunter along, absorbed by his chimera, dressed in
      gray, with gray gaiters, a little hat over his ear, a light top coat on
      his arm, imagining that the stage represented a country scene in the
      suburbs of Paris, and that he was playing the part of a Parisian
      sojourning in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for M. Chebe, who prided himself on being as fond of nature as the late
      Jean Jacques Rousseau, he did not appreciate it without the accompaniments
      of shooting-matches, wooden horses, sack races, and a profusion of dust
      and penny-whistles, which constituted also Madame Chebe&rsquo;s ideal of a
      country life.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sidonie had a different ideal; and those Parisian Sundays passed in
      strolling through noisy village streets depressed her beyond measure. Her
      only pleasure in those throngs was the consciousness of being stared at.
      The veriest boor&rsquo;s admiration, frankly expressed aloud at her side, made
      her smile all day; for she was of those who disdain no compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, leaving the Chebes and Delobelle in the midst of the fete,
      Risler would go into the fields with his brother and the &ldquo;little one&rdquo; in
      search of flowers for patterns for his wall-papers. Frantz, with his long
      arms, would pull down the highest branches of a hawthorn, or would climb a
      park wall to pick a leaf of graceful shape he had spied on the other side.
      But they reaped their richest harvests on the banks of the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they found those flexible plants, with long swaying stalks, which
      made such a lovely effect on hangings, tall, straight reeds, and the
      volubilis, whose flower, opening suddenly as if in obedience to a caprice,
      resembles a living face, some one looking at you amid the lovely,
      quivering foliage. Risler arranged his bouquets artistically, drawing his
      inspiration from the very nature of the plants, trying to understand
      thoroughly their manner of life, which can not be divined after the
      withering of one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, when the bouquet was completed, tied with a broad blade of grass as
      with a ribbon, and slung over Frantz&rsquo;s back, away they went. Risler,
      always engrossed in his art, looked about for subjects, for possible
      combinations, as they walked along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look there, little one&mdash;see that bunch of lily of the valley, with
      its white bells, among those eglantines. What do you think? Wouldn&rsquo;t that
      be pretty against a sea-green or pearl-gray background?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Sidonie cared no more for lilies of the valley than for eglantine.
      Wild flowers always seemed to her like the flowers of the poor, something
      like her lilac dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remembered that she had seen flowers of a different sort at the house
      of M. Gardinois, at the Chateau de Savigny, in the hothouses, on the
      balconies, and all about the gravelled courtyard bordered with tall urns.
      Those were the flowers she loved; that was her idea of the country!
    </p>
    <p>
      The little stations in the outskirts of Paris are so terribly crowded and
      stuffy on those Sunday evenings in summer! Such artificial enjoyment, such
      idiotic laughter, such doleful ballads, sung in whispers by voices that no
      longer have the strength to roar! That was the time when M. Chebe was in
      his element.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would elbow his way to the gate, scold about the delay of the train,
      declaim against the station-agent, the company, the government; say to
      Delobelle in a loud voice, so as to be overheard by his neighbors:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say&mdash;suppose such a thing as this should happen in America!&rdquo; Which
      remark, thanks to the expressive by-play of the illustrious actor, and to
      the superior air with which he replied, &ldquo;I believe you!&rdquo; gave those who
      stood near to understand that these gentlemen knew exactly what would
      happen in America in such a case. Now, they were equally and entirely
      ignorant on that subject; but upon the crowd their words made an
      impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting beside Frantz, with half of his bundle of flowers on her knees,
      Sidonie would seem to be blotted out, as it were, amid the uproar, during
      the long wait for the evening trains. From the station, lighted by a
      single lamp, she could see the black clumps of trees outside, lighted here
      and there by the last illuminations of the fete, a dark village street,
      people continually coming in, and a lantern hanging on a deserted pier.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time, on the other side of the glass doors, a train would
      rush by without stopping, with a shower of hot cinders and the roar of
      escaping steam. Thereupon a tempest of shouts and stamping would arise in
      the station, and, soaring above all the rest, the shrill treble of M.
      Chebe, shrieking in his sea-gull&rsquo;s voice: &ldquo;Break down the doors! break
      down the doors!&rdquo;&mdash;a thing that the little man would have taken good
      care not to do himself, as he had an abject fear of gendarmes. In a moment
      the storm would abate. The tired women, their hair disarranged by the
      wind, would fall asleep on the benches. There were torn and ragged
      dresses, low-necked white gowns, covered with dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air they breathed consisted mainly of dust. It lay upon their clothes,
      rose at every step, obscured the light of the lamp, vexed one&rsquo;s eyes, and
      raised a sort of cloud before the tired faces. The cars which they entered
      at last, after hours of waiting, were saturated with it also. Sidonie
      would open the window, and look out at the dark fields, an endless line of
      shadow. Then, like innumerable stars, the first lanterns of the outer
      boulevards appeared near the fortifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      So ended the ghastly day of rest of all those poor creatures. The sight of
      Paris brought back to each one&rsquo;s mind the thought of the morrow&rsquo;s toil.
      Dismal as her Sunday had been, Sidonie began to regret that it had passed.
      She thought of the rich, to whom all the days of their lives were days of
      rest; and vaguely, as in a dream, the long park avenues of which she had
      caught glimpses during the day appeared to her thronged with those happy
      ones of earth, strolling on the fine gravel, while outside the gate, in
      the dust of the highroad, the poor man&rsquo;s Sunday hurried swiftly by, having
      hardly time to pause a moment to look and envy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was little Chebe&rsquo;s life from thirteen to seventeen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The years passed, but did not bring with them the slightest change. Madame
      Chebe&rsquo;s cashmere was a little more threadbare, the little lilac frock had
      undergone a few additional repairs, and that was all. But, as Sidonie grew
      older, Frantz, now become a young man, acquired a habit of gazing at her
      silently with a melting expression, of paying her loving attentions that
      were visible to everybody, and were unnoticed by none save the girl
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, nothing aroused the interest of little Chebe. In the work-room she
      performed her task regularly, silently, without the slightest thought of
      the future or of saving. All that she did seemed to be done as if she were
      waiting for something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frantz, on the other hand, had been working for some time with
      extraordinary energy, the ardor of those who see something at the end of
      their efforts; so that, at the age of twenty-four, he graduated second in
      his class from the Ecole Centrale, as an engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that evening Risler had taken the Chebe family to the Gymnase, and
      throughout the evening he and Madame Chebe had been making signs and
      winking at each other behind the children&rsquo;s backs. And when they left the
      theatre Madame Chebe solemnly placed Sidonie&rsquo;s arm in Frantz&rsquo;s, as if she
      would say to the lovelorn youth, &ldquo;Now settle matters&mdash;here is your
      chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the poor lover tried to settle matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a long walk from the Gymnase to the Marais. After a very few steps
      the brilliancy of the boulevard is left behind, the streets become darker
      and darker, the passers more and more rare. Frantz began by talking of the
      play. He was very fond of comedies of that sort, in which there was plenty
      of sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Sidonie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! as for me, Frantz, you know that so long as there are fine costumes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In truth she thought of nothing else at the theatre. She was not one of
      those sentimental creatures; a la Madame Bovary, who return from the play
      with love-phrases ready-made, a conventional ideal. No! the theatre simply
      made her long madly for luxury and fine raiment; she brought away from it
      nothing but new methods of arranging the hair, and patterns of gowns. The
      new, exaggerated toilettes of the actresses, their gait, even the spurious
      elegance of their speech, which seemed to her of the highest distinction,
      and with it all the tawdry magnificence of the gilding and the lights, the
      gaudy placard at the door, the long line of carriages, and all the
      somewhat unwholesome excitement that springs up about a popular play; that
      was what she loved, that was what absorbed her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How well they acted their love-scene!&rdquo; continued the lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, as he uttered that suggestive phrase, he bent fondly toward a little
      face surrounded by a white woollen hood, from which the hair escaped in
      rebellious curls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidonie sighed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, the love-scene. The actress wore beautiful diamonds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. Poor Frantz had much difficulty in
      explaining himself. The words he sought would not come, and then, too, he
      was afraid. He fixed the time mentally when he would speak:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we have passed the Porte Saint-Denis&mdash;when we have left the
      boulevard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when the time arrived, Sidonie began to talk of such indifferent
      matters that his declaration froze on his lips, or else it was stopped by
      a passing carriage, which enabled their elders to overtake them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, in the Marais, he suddenly took courage:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Sidonie&mdash;I love you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night the Delobelles had sat up very late.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the habit of those brave-hearted women to make their working-day as
      long as possible, to prolong it so far into the night that their lamp was
      among the last to be extinguished on the quiet Rue de Braque. They always
      sat up until the great man returned home, and kept a dainty little supper
      warm for him in the ashes on the hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the days when he was an actor there was some reason for that custom;
      actors, being obliged to dine early and very sparingly, have a terrible
      gnawing at their vitals when they leave the theatre, and usually eat when
      they go home. Delobelle had not acted for a long time; but having, as he
      said, no right to abandon the stage, he kept his mania alive by clinging
      to a number of the strolling player&rsquo;s habits, and the supper on returning
      home was one of them, as was his habit of delaying his return until the
      last footlight in the boulevard theatres was extinguished. To retire
      without supping, at the hour when all other artists supped, would have
      been to abdicate, to abandon the struggle, and he would not abandon it,
      sacre bleu!
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening in question the actor had not yet come in and the women
      were waiting for him, talking as they worked, and with great animation,
      notwithstanding the lateness of the hour. During the whole evening they
      had done nothing but talk of Frantz, of his success, of the future that
      lay before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mamma Delobelle, &ldquo;the only thing he needs is to find a good
      little wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was Desiree&rsquo;s opinion, too. That was all that was lacking now to
      Frantz&rsquo;s happiness, a good little wife, active and brave and accustomed to
      work, who would forget everything for him. And if Desiree spoke with great
      confidence, it was because she was intimately acquainted with the woman
      who was so well adapted to Frantz Risler&rsquo;s needs. She was only a year
      younger than he, just enough to make her younger than her husband and a
      mother to him at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty?
    </p>
    <p>
      No, not exactly, but attractive rather than ugly, notwithstanding her
      infirmity, for she was lame, poor child! And then she was clever and
      bright, and so loving! No one but Desiree knew how fondly that little
      woman loved Frantz, and how she had thought of him night and day for
      years. He had not noticed it himself, but seemed to have eyes for nobody
      but Sidonie, a gamine. But no matter! Silent love is so eloquent, such a
      mighty power lies hid in restrained feelings. Who knows? Perhaps some day
      or other:
    </p>
    <p>
      And the little cripple, leaning over her work, started upon one of those
      long journeys to the land of chimeras of which she had made so many in her
      invalid&rsquo;s easychair, with her feet resting on the stool; one of those
      wonderful journeys from which she always returned happy and smiling,
      leaning on Frantz&rsquo;s arm with all the confidence of a beloved wife. As her
      fingers followed her thought, the little bird she had in her hand at the
      moment, smoothing his ruffled wings, looked as if he too were of the party
      and were about to fly far, far away, as joyous and light of heart as she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the door flew open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not disturb you?&rdquo; said a triumphant voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother, who was slightly drowsy, suddenly raised her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it&rsquo;s Monsieur Frantz. Pray come in, Monsieur Frantz. We&rsquo;re waiting
      for father, as you see. These brigands of artists always stay out so late!
      Take a seat&mdash;you shall have supper with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, thank you,&rdquo; replied Frantz, whose lips were still pale from the
      emotion he had undergone, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop. I saw a light and I just stepped
      in to tell you&mdash;to tell you some great news that will make you very
      happy, because I know that you love me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great heavens, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Frantz Risler and Mademoiselle Sidonie are engaged to be
      married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! didn&rsquo;t I say that all he needed was a good little wife,&rdquo; exclaimed
      Mamma Delobelle, rising and throwing her arms about his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Desiree had not the strength to utter a word. She bent still lower over
      her work, and as Frantz&rsquo;s eyes were fixed exclusively upon his happiness,
      as Mamma Delobelle did nothing but look at the clock to see whether her
      great man would return soon, no one noticed the lame girl&rsquo;s emotion, nor
      her pallor, nor the convulsive trembling of the little bird that lay in
      her hands with its head thrown back, like a bird with its death-wound.

      CHAPTER IV. THE GLOW-WORMS OF SAVIGNY
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SAVIGNY-SUR-ORGE.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR SMONIE:&mdash;We were sitting at table yesterday in the great
      dining-room which you remember, with the door wide open leading to the
      terrace, where the flowers are all in bloom. I was a little bored. Dear
      grandpapa had been cross all the morning, and poor mamma dared not say a
      word, being afraid of those frowning eyebrows which have always laid down
      the law for her. I was thinking what a pity it was to be so entirely
      alone, in the middle of the summer, in such a lovely spot, and that I
      should be very glad, now that I have left the convent, and am destined to
      pass whole seasons in the country, to have as in the old day, some one to
      run about the woods and paths with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, Georges comes occasionally, but he always arrives very late,
      just in time for dinner, and is off again with my father in the morning
      before I am awake. And then he is a serious-minded man now, is Monsieur
      Georges. He works at the factory, and business cares often bring frowns to
      his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had reached that point in my reflections when suddenly dear grandpapa
      turned abruptly to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What has become of your little friend Sidonie? I should be glad to have
      her here for a time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can imagine my delight. What happiness to meet again, to renew the
      pleasant friendship that was broken off by the fault of the events of life
      rather than by our own! How many things we shall have to tell each other!
      You, who alone had the knack of driving the frowns from my terrible
      grandpapa&rsquo;s brow, will bring us gayety, and I assure you we need it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This lovely Savigny is so lonely! For instance, sometimes in the morning
      I choose to be a little coquettish. I dress myself, I make myself
      beautiful with my hair in curls and put on a pretty gown; I walk through
      all the paths, and suddenly I realize that I have taken all this trouble
      for the swans and ducks, my dog Kiss, and the cows, who do not even turn
      to look at me when I pass. Thereupon, in my wrath, I hurry home, put on a
      thick gown and busy myself on the farm, in the servants&rsquo; quarters,
      everywhere. And really, I am beginning to believe that ennui has perfected
      me, and that I shall make an excellent housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luckily the hunting season will soon be here, and I rely upon that for a
      little amusement. In the first place, Georges and father, both
      enthusiastic sportsmen, will come oftener. And then you will be here, you
      know. For you will reply at once that you will come, won&rsquo;t you? Monsieur
      Risler said not long ago that you were not well. The air of Savigny will
      do you worlds of good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody here expects you. And I am dying with impatience.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
               &ldquo;CLAIRE.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Her letter written, Claire Fromont donned a large straw hat for the first
      days of August were warm and glorious&mdash;and went herself to drop it in
      the little box from which the postman collected the mail from the chateau
      every morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the edge of the park, at a turn in the road. She paused a moment
      to look at the trees by the roadside, at the neighboring meadows sleeping
      in the bright sunlight. Over yonder the reapers were gathering the last
      sheaves. Farther on they were ploughing. But all the melancholy of the
      silent toil had vanished, so far as the girl was concerned, so delighted
      was she at the thought of seeing her friend once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      No breeze came from the hills in the distance, no voice from the trees, to
      warn her by a presentiment, to prevent her from sending that fatal letter.
      And immediately upon her return she gave her attention to the preparation
      of a pretty bedroom for Sidonie adjoining her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter did its errand faithfully. From the little green,
      vine-embowered gate of the chateau it found its way to Paris, and arrived
      that same evening, with its Savigny postmark and impregnated with the odor
      of the country, at the fifth-floor apartment on the Rue de Braque.
    </p>
    <p>
      What an event that was! They read it again and again; and for a whole
      week, until Sidonie&rsquo;s departure, it lay on the mantel-shelf beside Madame
      Chebe&rsquo;s treasures, the clock under a glass globe and the Empire cups. To
      Sidonie it was like a wonderful romance filled with tales of enchantment
      and promises, which she read without opening it, merely by gazing at the
      white envelope whereon Claire Fromont&rsquo;s monogram was engraved in relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little she thought of marriage now. The important question was, What
      clothes should she wear at the chateau? She must give her whole mind to
      that, to cutting and planning, trying on dresses, devising new ways of
      arranging her hair. Poor Frantz! How heavy his heart was made by these
      preparations! That visit to Savigny, which he had tried vainly to oppose,
      would cause a still further postponement of their wedding, which
      Sidonie-why, he did not know&mdash;persisted in putting off from day to
      day. He could not go to see her; and when she was once there, in the midst
      of festivities and pleasures, who could say how long she would remain?
    </p>
    <p>
      The lover in his despair always went to the Delobelles to confide his
      sorrows, but he never noticed how quickly Desiree rose as soon as he
      entered, to make room for him by her side at the work-table, and how she
      at once sat down again, with cheeks as red as fire and shining eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some days past they had ceased to work at birds and insects for
      ornament. The mother and daughter were hemming pink flounces destined for
      Sidonie&rsquo;s frock, and the little cripple never had plied her needle with
      such good heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth little Desiree was not Delobelle&rsquo;s daughter to no purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      She inherited her father&rsquo;s faculty of retaining his illusions, of hoping
      on to the end and even beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Frantz was dilating upon his woe, Desire was thinking that, when
      Sidonie was gone, he would come every day, if it were only to talk about
      the absent one; that she would have him there by her side, that they would
      sit up together waiting for &ldquo;father,&rdquo; and that, perhaps, some evening, as
      he sat looking at her, he would discover the difference between the woman
      who loves you and the one who simply allows herself to be loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the thought that every stitch taken in the frock tended to
      hasten the departure which she anticipated with such impatience imparted
      extraordinary activity to her needle, and the unhappy lover ruefully
      watched the flounces and ruffles piling up about her, like little pink,
      white-capped waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the pink frock was finished, Mademoiselle Chebe started for Savigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chateau of M. Gardinois was built in the valley of the Orge, on the
      bank of that capriciously lovely stream, with its windmills, its little
      islands, its dams, and its broad lawns that end at its shores.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chateau, an old Louis-Quinze structure, low in reality, although made
      to appear high by a pointed roof, had a most depressing aspect, suggestive
      of aristocratic antiquity; broad steps, balconies with rusty balustrades,
      old urns marred by time, wherein the flowers stood out vividly against the
      reddish stone. As far as the eye could see, the walls stretched away,
      decayed and crumbling, descending gradually toward the stream. The chateau
      overlooked them, with its high, slated roofs, the farmhouse, with its red
      tiles, and the superb park, with its lindens, ash-trees, poplars and
      chestnuts growing confusedly together in a dense black mass, cut here and
      there by the arched openings of the paths.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the charm of the old place was the water, which enlivened its silence
      and gave character to its beautiful views. There were at Savigny, to say
      nothing of the river, many springs, fountains, and ponds, in which the sun
      sank to rest in all his glory; and they formed a suitable setting for that
      venerable mansion, green and mossy as it was, and slightly worn away, like
      a stone on the edge of a brook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unluckily, at Savigny, as in most of those gorgeous Parisian summer
      palaces, which the parvenus in commerce and speculation have made their
      prey, the chatelains were not in harmony with the chateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since he had purchased his chateau, old Gardinois had done nothing but
      injure the beauty of the beautiful property chance had placed in his
      hands; cut down trees &ldquo;for the view,&rdquo; filled his park with rough
      obstructions to keep out trespassers, and reserved all his solicitude for
      a magnificent kitchen-garden, which, as it produced fruit and vegetables
      in abundance, seemed to him more like his own part of the country&mdash;the
      land of the peasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the great salons, where the panels with paintings of famous
      subjects were fading in the autumn fogs, as for the ponds overrun with
      water-lilies, the grottoes, the stone bridges, he cared for them only
      because of the admiration of visitors, and because of such elements was
      composed that thing which so flattered his vanity as an ex-dealer in
      cattle&mdash;a chateau!
    </p>
    <p>
      Being already old, unable to hunt or fish, he passed his time
      superintending the most trivial details of that large property. The grain
      for the hens, the price of the last load of the second crop of hay, the
      number of bales of straw stored in a magnificent circular granary,
      furnished him with matter for scolding for a whole day; and certain it is
      that, when one gazed from a distance at that lovely estate of Savigny, the
      chateau on the hillside, the river, like a mirror, flowing at its feet,
      the high terraces shaded by ivy, the supporting wall of the park following
      the majestic slope of the ground, one never would have suspected the
      proprietor&rsquo;s niggardliness and meanness of spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the idleness consequent upon his wealth, M. Gardinois, being greatly
      bored in Paris, lived at Savigny throughout the year, and the Fromonts
      lived with him during the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Fromont was a mild, dull woman, whom her father&rsquo;s brutal despotism
      had early molded to passive obedience for life. She maintained the same
      attitude with her husband, whose constant kindness and indulgence never
      had succeeded in triumphing over that humiliated, taciturn nature,
      indifferent to everything, and, in some sense, irresponsible. Having
      passed her life with no knowledge of business, she had become rich without
      knowing it and without the slightest desire to take advantage of it. Her
      fine apartments in Paris, her father&rsquo;s magnificent chateau, made her
      uncomfortable. She occupied as small a place as possible in both, filling
      her life with a single passion, order&mdash;a fantastic, abnormal sort of
      order, which consisted in brushing, wiping, dusting, and polishing the
      mirrors, the gilding and the door-knobs, with her own hands, from morning
      till night.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had nothing else to clean, the strange woman would attack her
      rings, her watch-chain, her brooches, scrubbing the cameos and pearls,
      and, by dint of polishing the combination of her own name and her
      husband&rsquo;s, she had effaced all the letters of both. Her fixed idea
      followed her to Savigny. She picked up dead branches in the paths,
      scratched the moss from the benches with the end of her umbrella, and
      would have liked to dust the leaves and sweep down the old trees; and
      often, when in the train, she looked with envy at the little villas
      standing in a line along the track, white and clean, with their gleaming
      utensils, the pewter ball, and the little oblong gardens, which resemble
      drawers in a bureau. Those were her ideal of a country-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Fromont, who came only occasionally and was always absorbed by his
      business affairs, enjoyed Savigny little more than she. Claire alone felt
      really at home in that lovely park. She was familiar with its smallest
      shrub. Being obliged to provide her own amusements, like all only
      children, she had become attached to certain walks, watched the flowers
      bloom, had her favorite path, her favorite tree, her favorite bench for
      reading. The dinner-bell always surprised her far away in the park. She
      would come to the table, out of breath but happy, flushed with the fresh
      air. The shadow of the hornbeams, stealing over that youthful brow, had
      imprinted a sort of gentle melancholy there, and the deep, dark green of
      the ponds, crossed by vague rays, was reflected in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those lovely surroundings had in very truth shielded her from the
      vulgarity and the abjectness of the persons about her. M. Gardinois might
      deplore in her presence, for hours at a time, the perversity of tradesmen
      and servants, or make an estimate of what was being stolen from him each
      month, each week, every day, every minute; Madame Fromont might enumerate
      her grievances against the mice, the maggots, dust and dampness, all
      desperately bent upon destroying her property, and engaged in a conspiracy
      against her wardrobes; not a word of their foolish talk remained in
      Claire&rsquo;s mind. A run around the lawn, an hour&rsquo;s reading on the river-bank,
      restored the tranquillity of that noble and intensely active mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her grandfather looked upon her as a strange being, altogether out of
      place in his family. As a child she annoyed him with her great, honest
      eyes, her straightforwardness on all occasions, and also because he did
      not find in her a second edition of his own passive and submissive
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That child will be a proud chit and an original, like her father,&rdquo; he
      would say in his ugly moods.
    </p>
    <p>
      How much better he liked that little Chebe girl who used to come now and
      then and play in the avenues at Savigny! In her, at least, he detected the
      strain of the common people like himself, with a sprinkling of ambition
      and envy, suggested even in those early days by a certain little smile at
      the corner of the mouth. Moreover, the child exhibited an ingenuous
      amazement and admiration in presence of his wealth, which flattered his
      parvenu pride; and sometimes, when he teased her, she would break out with
      the droll phrases of a Paris gamine, slang redolent of the faubourgs,
      seasoned by her pretty, piquant face, inclined to pallor, which not even
      superficiality could deprive of its distinction. So he never had forgotten
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this occasion above all, when Sidonie arrived at Savigny after her long
      absence, with her fluffy hair, her graceful figure, her bright, mobile
      face, the whole effect emphasized by mannerisms suggestive of the
      shop-girl, she produced a decided sensation. Old Gardinois, wondering
      greatly to see a tall young woman in place of the child he was expecting
      to see, considered her prettier and, above all, better dressed than
      Claire.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a fact that, when Mademoiselle Chebe had left the train and was
      seated in the great wagonette from the chateau, her appearance was not
      bad; but she lacked those details that constituted her friend&rsquo;s chief
      beauty and charm&mdash;a distinguished carriage, a contempt for poses,
      and, more than all else, mental tranquillity. Her prettiness was not
      unlike her gowns, of inexpensive materials, but cut according to the style
      of the day-rags, if you will, but rags of which fashion, that ridiculous
      but charming fairy, had regulated the color, the trimming, and the shape.
      Paris has pretty faces made expressly for costumes of that sort, very easy
      to dress becomingly, for the very reason that they belong to no type, and
      Mademoiselle Sidonie&rsquo;s face was one of these.
    </p>
    <p>
      What bliss was hers when the carriage entered the long avenue, bordered
      with velvety grass and primeval elms, and at the end Savigny awaiting her
      with its great gate wide open!
    </p>
    <p>
      And how thoroughly at ease she felt amid all those refinements of wealth!
      How perfectly that sort of life suited her! It seemed to her that she
      never had known any other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, in the midst of her intoxication, arrived a letter from Frantz,
      which brought her back to the realities of her life, to her wretched fate
      as the future wife of a government clerk, which transported her, whether
      she would or no, to the mean little apartment they would occupy some day
      at the top of some dismal house, whose heavy atmosphere, dense with
      privation, she seemed already to breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should she break her betrothal promise?
    </p>
    <p>
      She certainly could do it, as she had given no other pledge than her word.
      But when he had left her, who could say that she would not wish him back?
    </p>
    <p>
      In that little brain, turned by ambition, the strangest ideas chased one
      another. Sometimes, while Grandfather Gardinois, who had laid aside in her
      honor his old-fashioned hunting-jackets and swanskin waistcoats, was
      jesting with her, amusing himself by contradicting her in order to draw
      out a sharp reply, she would gaze steadily, coldly into his eyes, without
      replying. Ah! if only he were ten years younger! But the thought of
      becoming Madame Gardinois did not long occupy her. A new personage, a new
      hope came into her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Sidonie&rsquo;s arrival, Georges Fromont, who was seldom seen at Savigny
      except on Sundays, adopted the habit of coming to dinner almost every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a tall, slender, pale youth, of refined appearance. Having no
      father or mother, he had been brought up by his uncle, M. Fromont, and was
      looked upon by him to succeed him in business, and probably to become
      Claire&rsquo;s husband. That ready-made future did not arouse any enthusiasm in
      Georges. In the first place business bored him. As for his cousin, the
      intimate good-fellowship of an education in common and mutual confidence
      existed between them, but nothing more, at least on his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Sidonie, on the contrary, he was exceedingly embarrassed and shy, and
      at the same time desirous of producing an effect&mdash;a totally different
      man, in short. She had just the spurious charm, a little free, which was
      calculated to attract a superficial nature, and it was not long before she
      discovered the impression that she produced upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the two girls were walking together in the park, it was always
      Sidonie who remembered that it was time for the train from Paris to
      arrive. They would go together to the gate to meet the travellers, and
      Georges&rsquo;s first glance was always for Mademoiselle Chebe, who remained a
      little behind her friend, but with the poses and airs that go halfway to
      meet the eyes. That manoeuvring between them lasted some time. They did
      not mention love, but all the words, all the smiles they exchanged were
      full of silent avowals.
    </p>
    <p>
      One cloudy and threatening summer evening, when the two friends had left
      the table as soon as dinner was at an end and were walking in the long,
      shady avenue, Georges joined them. They were talking upon indifferent
      subjects, crunching the gravel beneath their idling footsteps, when Madame
      Fromont&rsquo;s voice, from the chateau, called Claire away. Georges and Sidonie
      were left alone. They continued to walk along the avenue, guided by the
      uncertain whiteness of the path, without speaking of drawing nearer to
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      A warm wind rustled among the leaves. The ruffled surface of the pond
      lapped softly against the arches of the little bridge; and the blossoms of
      the acacias and lindens, detached by the breeze, whirled about in circles,
      perfuming the electricity-laden air. They felt themselves surrounded by an
      atmosphere of storm, vibrant and penetrating. Dazzling flashes of heat
      passed before their troubled eyes, like those that played along the
      horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what lovely glow-worms!&rdquo; exclaimed Sidonie, embarrassed by the
      oppressive silence broken by so many mysterious sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the edge of the greensward a blade of grass here and there was
      illuminated by a tiny, green, flickering light. She stooped to lift one on
      her glove. Georges knelt close beside her; and as they leaned down, their
      hair and cheeks touching, they gazed at each other for a moment by the
      light of the glow-worms. How weird and fascinating she seemed to him in
      that green light, which shone upon her face and died away in the fine
      network of her waving hair! He put his arm around her waist, and suddenly,
      feeling that she abandoned herself to him, he clasped her in a long,
      passionate embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you looking for?&rdquo; asked Claire, suddenly coming up in the shadow
      behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taken by surprise, and with a choking sensation in his throat, Georges
      trembled so that he could not reply. Sidonie, on the other hand, rose with
      the utmost coolness, and said as she shook out her skirt:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The glow-worms. See how many of them there are tonight. And how they
      sparkle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes also sparkled with extraordinary brilliancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The storm makes them, I suppose,&rdquo; murmured Georges, still trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm was indeed near. At brief intervals great clouds of leaves and
      dust whirled from one end of the avenue to the other. They walked a few
      steps farther, then all three returned to the house. The young women took
      their work, Georges tried to read a newspaper, while Madame Fromont
      polished her rings and M. Gardinois and his son-in-law played billiards in
      the adjoining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long that evening seemed to Sidonie! She had but one wish, to be
      alone-alone with her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, in the silence of her little bedroom, when she had put out her light,
      which interferes with dreams by casting too bright an illumination upon
      reality, what schemes, what transports of delight! Georges loved her,
      Georges Fromont, the heir of the factory! They would marry; she would be
      rich. For in that mercenary little heart the first kiss of love had
      awakened no ideas save those of ambition and a life of luxury.
    </p>
    <p>
      To assure herself that her lover was sincere, she tried to recall the
      scene under the trees to its most trifling details, the expression of his
      eyes, the warmth of his embrace, the vows uttered brokenly, lips to lips,
      it that weird light shed by the glow-worms, which one solemn moment had
      fixed forever in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! the glow-worms of Savigny!
    </p>
    <p>
      All night long they twinkled like stars before her closed eyes. The park
      was full of them, to the farthest limits of its darkest paths. There were
      clusters of them all along the lawns, on the trees, in the shrubbery. The
      fine gravel of the avenues, the waves of the river, seemed to emit green
      sparks, and all those microscopic flashes formed a sort of holiday
      illumination in which Savigny seemed to be enveloped in her honor, to
      celebrate the betrothal of Georges and Sidonie.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she rose the next day, her plan was formed. Georges loved her; that
      was certain. Did he contemplate marrying her? She had a suspicion that he
      did not, the clever minx! But that did not frighten her. She felt strong
      enough to triumph over that childish nature, at once weak and passionate.
      She had only to resist him, and that is exactly what she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some days she was cold and indifferent, wilfully blind and devoid of
      memory. He tried to speak to her, to renew the blissful moment, but she
      avoided him, always placing some one between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he wrote to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He carried his notes himself to a hollow in a rock near a clear spring
      called &ldquo;The Phantom,&rdquo; which was in the outskirts of the park, sheltered by
      a thatched roof. Sidonie thought that a charming episode. In the evening
      she must invent some story, a pretext of some sort for going to &ldquo;The
      Phantom&rdquo; alone. The shadow of the trees across the path, the mystery of
      the night, the rapid walk, the excitement, made her heart beat
      deliciously. She would find the letter saturated with dew, with the
      intense cold of the spring, and so white in the moonlight that she would
      hide it quickly for fear of being surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, when she was alone, what joy to open it, to decipher those magic
      characters, those words of love which swam before her eyes, surrounded by
      dazzling blue and yellow circles, as if she were reading her letter in the
      bright sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you! Love me!&rdquo; wrote Georges in every conceivable phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first she did not reply; but when she felt that he was fairly caught,
      entirely in her power, she declared herself concisely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never will love any one but my husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah! she was a true woman already, was little Chebe.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. HOW LITTLE CHEBE&rsquo;S STORY ENDED
    </h2>
    <p>
      Meanwhile September arrived. The hunting season brought together a large,
      noisy, vulgar party at the chateau. There were long dinners at which the
      wealthy bourgeois lingered slothfully and wearily, prone to fall asleep
      like peasants. They went in carriages to meet the returning hunters in the
      cool air of the autumn evening. The mist arose from the fields, from which
      the crops had been gathered; and while the frightened game flew along the
      stubble with plaintive cries, the darkness seemed to emerge from the
      forests whose dark masses increased in size, spreading out over the
      fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage lamps were lighted, the hoods raised, and they drove quickly
      homeward with the fresh air blowing in their faces. The dining-hall,
      brilliantly illuminated, was filled with gayety and laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire Fromont, embarrassed by the vulgarity of those about her, hardly
      spoke at all. Sidonie was at her brightest. The drive had given animation
      to her pale complexion and Parisian eyes. She knew how to laugh,
      understood a little too much, perhaps, and seemed to the male guests the
      only woman in the party. Her success completed Georges&rsquo;s intoxication; but
      as his advances became more pronounced, she showed more and more reserve.
      Thereupon he determined that she should be his wife. He swore it to
      himself, with the exaggerated emphasis of weak characters, who seem always
      to combat beforehand the difficulties to which they know that they must
      yield some day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the happiest moment of little Chebe&rsquo;s life. Even aside from any
      ambitious project, her coquettish, false nature found a strange
      fascination in this intrigue, carried on mysteriously amid banquets and
      merry-makings.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one about them suspected anything. Claire was at that healthy and
      delightful period of youth when the mind, only partly open, clings to the
      things it knows with blind confidence, in complete ignorance of treachery
      and falsehood. M. Fromont thought of nothing but his business. His wife
      polished her jewels with frenzied energy. Only old Gardinois and his
      little, gimlet-like eyes were to be feared; but Sidonie entertained him,
      and even if he had discovered anything, he was not the man to interfere
      with her future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hour of triumph was near, when a sudden, unforeseen disaster blasted
      her hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Sunday morning M. Fromont was brought back fatally wounded from a
      hunting expedition. A bullet intended for a deer had pierced his temple.
      The chateau was turned upside-down.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the hunters, among them the unknown bungler that had fired the fatal
      shot, started in haste for Paris. Claire, frantic with grief, entered the
      room where her father lay on his deathbed, there to remain; and Risler,
      being advised of the catastrophe, came to take Sidonie home.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night before her departure she had a final meeting with Georges at
      The Phantom,&mdash;a farewell meeting, painful and stealthy, and made
      solemn by the proximity of death. They vowed, however, to love each other
      always; they agreed upon a method of writing to each other. Then they
      parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sad journey home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidonie returned abruptly to her every-day life, escorted by the
      despairing grief of Risler, to whom his dear master&rsquo;s death was an
      irreparable loss. On her arrival, she was compelled to describe her visit
      to the smallest detail; discuss the inmates of the chateau, the guests,
      the entertainments, the dinners, and the final catastrophe. What torture
      for her, when, absorbed as she was by a single, unchanging thought, she
      had so much need of silence and solitude! But there was something even
      more terrible than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first day after her return Frantz resumed his former place; and the
      glances with which he followed her, the words he addressed to her alone,
      seemed to her exasperating beyond endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite all his shyness and distrust of himself, the poor fellow believed
      that he had some rights as an accepted and impatient lover, and little
      Chebe was obliged to emerge from her dreams to reply to that creditor, and
      to postpone once more the maturity of his claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      A day came, however, when indecision ceased to be possible. She had
      promised to marry Frantz when he had obtained a good situation; and now an
      engineer&rsquo;s berth in the South, at the smelting-furnaces of Grand Combe,
      was offered to him. That was sufficient for the support of a modest
      establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no way of avoiding the question. She must either keep her
      promise or invent an excuse for breaking it. But what excuse could she
      invent?
    </p>
    <p>
      In that pressing emergency, she thought of Desiree. Although the lame
      little girl had never confided in her, she knew of her great love for
      Frantz. Long ago she had detected it, with her coquette&rsquo;s eyes, bright and
      changing mirrors, which reflected all the thoughts of others without
      betraying any of her own. It may be that the thought that another woman
      loved her betrothed had made Frantz&rsquo;s love more endurable to her at first;
      and, just as we place statues on tombstones to make them appear less sad,
      Desiree&rsquo;s pretty, little, pale face at the threshold of that uninviting
      future had made it seem less forbidding to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it provided&mdash;her with a simple and honorable pretext for freeing
      herself from her promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I tell you, mamma,&rdquo; she said to Madame Chebe one day, &ldquo;I never will
      consent to make a friend like her unhappy. I should suffer too much from
      remorse,&mdash;poor Desiree! Haven&rsquo;t you noticed how badly she looks since
      I came home; what a beseeching way she has of looking at me? No, I won&rsquo;t
      cause her that sorrow; I won&rsquo;t take away her Frantz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even while she admired her daughter&rsquo;s generous spirit, Madame Chebe looked
      upon that as a rather exaggerated sacrifice, and remonstrated with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, my child; we aren&rsquo;t rich. A husband like Frantz doesn&rsquo;t turn
      up every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! then I won&rsquo;t marry at all,&rdquo; declared Sidonie flatly, and,
      deeming her pretext an excellent one, she clung persistently to it.
      Nothing could shake her determination, neither the tears shed by Frantz,
      who was exasperated by her refusal to fulfil her promise, enveloped as it
      was in vague reasons which she would not even explain to him, nor the
      entreaties of Risler, in whose ear Madame Chebe had mysteriously mumbled
      her daughter&rsquo;s reasons, and who in spite of everything could not but
      admire such a sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t revile her, I tell you! She&rsquo;s an angel!&rdquo; he said to his brother,
      striving to soothe him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes, she is an angel,&rdquo; assented Madame Chebe with a sigh, so that the
      poor betrayed lover had not even the right to complain. Driven to despair,
      he determined to leave Paris, and as Grand Combe seemed too near in his
      frenzied longing for flight, he asked and obtained an appointment as
      overseer on the Suez Canal at Ismailia. He went away without knowing, or
      caring to know aught of, Desiree&rsquo;s love; and yet, when he went to bid her
      farewell, the dear little cripple looked up into his face with her shy,
      pretty eyes, in which were plainly written the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you, if she does not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Frantz Risler did not know how to read what was written in those eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, hearts that are accustomed to suffer have an infinite store
      of patience. When her friend had gone, the lame girl, with her charming
      morsel of illusion, inherited from her father and refined by her feminine
      nature, returned bravely to her work, saying to herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will wait for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thereafter she spread the wings of her birds to their fullest extent,
      as if they were all going, one after another, to Ismailia in Egypt. And
      that was a long distance!
    </p>
    <p>
      Before sailing from Marseilles, young Risler wrote Sidonie a farewell
      letter, at once laughable and touching, wherein, mingling the most
      technical details with the most heartrending adieux, the unhappy engineer
      declared that he was about to set sail, with a broken heart, on the
      transport Sahib, &ldquo;a sailing-ship and steamship combined, with engines of
      fifteen-hundred-horse power,&rdquo; as if he hoped that so considerable a
      capacity would make an impression on his ungrateful betrothed, and cause
      her ceaseless remorse. But Sidonie had very different matters on her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was beginning to be disturbed by Georges&rsquo;s silence. Since she left
      Savigny she had heard from him only once. All her letters were left
      unanswered. To be sure, she knew through Risler that Georges was very
      busy, and that his uncle&rsquo;s death had thrown the management of the factory
      upon him, imposing upon him a responsibility that was beyond his strength.
      But to abandon her without a word!
    </p>
    <p>
      From the window on the landing, where she had resumed her silent
      observations&mdash;for she had so arranged matters as not to return to
      Mademoiselle Le Mire&mdash;little Chebe tried to distinguish her lover,
      watched him as he went to and fro across the yards and among the
      buildings; and in the afternoon, when it was time for the train to start
      for Savigny, she saw him enter his carriage to go to his aunt and cousin,
      who were passing the early months of their period of mourning at the
      grandfather&rsquo;s chateau in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this excited and alarmed her; and the proximity of the factory
      rendered Georges&rsquo;s avoidance of her even more apparent. To think that by
      raising her voice a little she could make him turn toward the place where
      she stood! To think that they were separated only by a wall! And yet, at
      that moment they were very far apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you remember, little Chebe, that unhappy winter evening when the
      excellent Risler rushed into your parents&rsquo; room with an extraordinary
      expression of countenance, exclaiming, &ldquo;Great news!&rdquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      Great news, indeed! Georges Fromont had just informed him that, in
      accordance with his uncle&rsquo;s last wishes, he was to marry his cousin
      Claire, and that, as he was certainly unequal to the task of carrying on
      the business alone, he had resolved to take him, Risler, for a partner,
      under the firm name of FROMONT JEUNE AND RISLER AINE.
    </p>
    <p>
      How did you succeed, little Chebe, in maintaining your self-possession
      when you learned that the factory had eluded your grasp and that another
      woman had taken your place? What a terrible evening!&mdash;Madame Chebe
      sat by the table mending; M. Chebe before the fire drying his clothes,
      which were wet through by his having walked a long distance in the rain.
      Oh! that miserable room, overflowing with gloom and ennui! The lamp gave a
      dim light. The supper, hastily prepared, had left in the room the odor of
      the poor man&rsquo;s kitchen. And Risler, intoxicated with joy, talking with
      increasing animation, laid great plans!
    </p>
    <p>
      All these things tore your heart, and made the treachery still more
      horrible by the contrast between the riches that eluded your outstretched
      hand and the ignoble mediocrity in which you were doomed to pass your
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidonie was seriously ill for a long while. As she lay in bed, whenever
      the window-panes rattled behind the curtains, the unhappy creature fancied
      that Georges&rsquo;s wedding-coaches were driving through the street; and she
      had paroxysms of nervous excitement, without words and inexplicable, as if
      a fever of wrath were consuming her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, time and youthful strength, her mother&rsquo;s care, and, more than
      all, the attentions of Desiree, who now knew of the sacrifice her friend
      had made for her, triumphed over the disease. But for a long while Sidonie
      was very weak, oppressed by a deadly melancholy, by a constant longing to
      weep, which played havoc with her nervous system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes she talked of travelling, of leaving Paris. At other times she
      insisted that she must enter a convent. Her friends were sorely perplexed,
      and strove to discover the cause of that singular state of mind, which was
      even more alarming than her illness; when she suddenly confessed to her
      mother the secret of her melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She loved the elder Risler! She never had dared to whisper it; but it was
      he whom she had always loved and not Frantz.
    </p>
    <p>
      This news was a surprise to everybody, to Risler most of all; but little
      Chebe was so pretty, her eyes were so soft when she glanced at him, that
      the honest fellow instantly became as fond of her as a fool! Indeed, it
      may be that love had lain in his heart for a long time without his
      realizing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that is how it happened that, on the evening of her wedding-day, young
      Madame Risler, in her white wedding-dress, gazed with a smile of triumph
      at the window on the landing which had been the narrow setting of ten
      years of her life. That haughty smile, in which there was a touch of
      profound pity and of scorn as well, such scorn as a parvenu feels for his
      poor beginnings, was evidently addressed to the poor sickly child whom she
      fancied she saw up at that window, in the depths of the past and the
      darkness. It seemed to say to Claire, pointing at the factory:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say to this little Chebe? She is here at last, you see!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. NOON&mdash;THE MARAIS IS BREAKFASTING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Sitting near the door, on a stone which once served as a horse-block for
      equestrians, Risler watches with a smile the exit from the factory. He
      never loses his enjoyment of the outspoken esteem of all these good people
      whom he knew when he was insignificant and humble like themselves. The
      &ldquo;Good-day, Monsieur Risler,&rdquo; uttered by so many different voices, all in
      the same affectionate tone, warms his heart. The children accost him
      without fear, the long-bearded designers, half-workmen, half-artists,
      shake hands with him as they pass, and address him familiarly as &ldquo;thou.&rdquo;
       Perhaps there is a little too much familiarity in all this, for the worthy
      man has not yet begun to realize the prestige and authority of his new
      station; and there was some one who considered this free-and-easy manner
      very humiliating. But that some one can not see him at this moment, and
      the master takes advantage of the fact to bestow a hearty greeting upon
      the old bookkeeper, Sigismond, who comes out last of all, erect and
      red-faced, imprisoned in a high collar and bareheaded&mdash;whatever the
      weather&mdash;for fear of apoplexy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and Risler are fellow-countrymen. They have for each other a profound
      esteem, dating from their first employment at the factory, from that time,
      long, long ago, when they breakfasted together at the little creamery on
      the corner, to which Sigismond Planus goes alone now and selects his
      refreshment for the day from the slate hanging on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      But stand aside! The carriage of Fromont Jeune drives through the gateway.
      He has been out on business all the morning; and the partners, as they
      walk toward the pretty little house in which they both live at the end of
      the garden, discuss matters of business in a friendly way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been at Prochasson&rsquo;s,&rdquo; says Fromont. &ldquo;They showed me some new
      patterns, pretty ones too, I assure you. We must be on our guard. They are
      dangerous rivals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Risler is not at all anxious. He is strong in his talent, his
      experience; and then&mdash;but this is strictly confidential&mdash;he is
      on the track of a wonderful invention, an improved printing-press,
      something that&mdash;but we shall see. Still talking, they enter the
      garden, which is as carefully kept as a public park, with round-topped
      acacias almost as old as the buildings, and magnificent ivies that hide
      the high, black walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside Fromont jeune, Risler Aine has the appearance of a clerk making his
      report to his employer. At every step he stops to speak, for his gait is
      heavy, his mind works slowly, and words have much difficulty in finding
      their way to his lips. Oh, if he could see the little flushed face up
      yonder, behind the window on the second floor, watching everything so
      attentively!
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Risler is waiting for her husband to come to breakfast, and waxes
      impatient over the good man&rsquo;s moderation. She motions to him with her
      hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; but Risler does not notice it. His attention is engrossed by
      the little Fromont, daughter of Claire and Georges, who is taking a
      sun-bath, blooming like a flower amid her lace in her nurse&rsquo;s arms. How
      pretty she is! &ldquo;She is your very picture, Madame Chorche.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so, my dear Risler? Why, everybody says she looks like her
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a little. But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And there they all stand, the father and mother, Risler and the nurse,
      gravely seeking resemblances in that miniature model of a human being, who
      stares at them out of her little eyes, blinking with the noise and glare.
      Sidonie, at her open window, leans out to see what they are doing, and why
      her husband does not come up.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Risler has taken the tiny creature in his arms, the whole
      fascinating bundle of white draperies and light ribbons, and is trying to
      make it laugh and crow with baby-talk and gestures worthy of a
      grandfather. How old he looks, poor man! His tall body, which he contorts
      for the child&rsquo;s amusement, his hoarse voice, which becomes a low growl
      when he tries to soften it, are absurd and ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above, the wife taps the floor with her foot and mutters between her
      teeth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idiot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last, weary of waiting, she sends a servant to tell Monsieur that
      breakfast is served; but the game is so far advanced that Monsieur does
      not see how he can go away, how he can interrupt these explosions of
      laughter and little bird-like cries. He succeeds at last, however, in
      giving the child back to its nurse, and enters the hall, laughing
      heartily. He is laughing still when he enters the dining-room; but a
      glance from his wife stops him short.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidonie is seated at table before the chafing-dish, already filled. Her
      martyr-like attitude suggests a determination to be cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! there you are. It&rsquo;s very lucky!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Risler took his seat, a little ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you have, my love? That child is so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have asked you before now not to speak to me in that way. It isn&rsquo;t good
      form.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, not when we&rsquo;re alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! you will never learn to adapt yourself to our new fortune. And what
      is the result? No one in this place treats me with any respect. Pere
      Achille hardly touches his hat to me when I pass his lodge. To be sure,
      I&rsquo;m not a Fromont, and I haven&rsquo;t a carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, little one, you know perfectly well that you can use Madame
      Chorche&rsquo;s coupe. She always says it is at our disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many times must I tell you that I don&rsquo;t choose to be under any
      obligation to that woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Sidonie&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, I know, it&rsquo;s all understood. Madame Fromont is the good Lord
      himself. Every one is forbidden to touch her. And I must make up my mind
      to be a nobody in my own house, to allow myself to be humiliated, trampled
      under foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, little one&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Risler tries to interpose, to say a word in favor of his dear Madame
      &ldquo;Chorche.&rdquo; But he has no tact. This is the worst possible method of
      effecting a reconciliation; and Sidonie at once bursts forth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you that that woman, with all her calm airs, is proud and
      spiteful. In the first place, she detests me, I know that. So long as I
      was poor little Sidonie and she could toss me her broken dolls and old
      clothes, it was all right, but now that I am my own mistress as well as
      she, it vexes her and humiliates her. Madame gives me advice with a lofty
      air, and criticises what I do. I did wrong to have a maid. Of course!
      Wasn&rsquo;t I in the habit of waiting on myself? She never loses a chance to
      wound me. When I call on her on Wednesdays, you should hear the tone in
      which she asks me, before everybody, how &lsquo;dear Madame Chebe&rsquo; is. Oh! yes.
      I&rsquo;m a Chebe and she&rsquo;s a Fromont. One&rsquo;s as good as the other, in my
      opinion. My grandfather was a druggist. What was hers? A peasant who got
      rich by money-lending. I&rsquo;ll tell her so one of these days, if she shows me
      too much of her pride; and I&rsquo;ll tell her, too, that their little imp,
      although they don&rsquo;t suspect it, looks just like that old Pere Gardinois,
      and heaven knows he isn&rsquo;t handsome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaims Risler, unable to find words to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, of course! I advise you to admire their child. She&rsquo;s always ill.
      She cries all night like a little cat. It keeps me awake. And afterward,
      through the day, I have mamma&rsquo;s piano and her scales&mdash;tra, la la la!
      If the music were only worth listening to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Risler has taken the wise course. He does not say a word until he sees
      that she is beginning to calm down a little, when he completes the
      soothing process with compliments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How pretty we are to-day! Are we going out soon to make some calls, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He resorts to this mode of address to avoid the more familiar form, which
      is so offensive to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not going to make calls,&rdquo; Sidonie replies with a certain pride.
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I expect to receive them. This is my day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In response to her husband&rsquo;s astounded, bewildered expression she
      continues:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, this is my day. Madame Fromont has one; I can have one also, I
      fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; said honest Risler, looking about with some little
      uneasiness. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why I saw so many flowers everywhere, on the
      landing and in the drawing-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my maid went down to the garden this morning. Did I do wrong? Oh!
      you don&rsquo;t say so, but I&rsquo;m sure you think I did wrong. &lsquo;Dame&rsquo;! I thought
      the flowers in the garden belonged to us as much as to the Fromonts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly they do&mdash;but you&mdash;it would have been better perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To ask leave? That&rsquo;s it-to humble myself again for a few paltry
      chrysanthemums and two or three bits of green. Besides, I didn&rsquo;t make any
      secret of taking the flowers; and when she comes up a little later&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she coming? Ah! that&rsquo;s very kind of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sidonie turned upon him indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? Kind of her? Upon my word, if she doesn&rsquo;t come, it would be
      the last straw. When I go every Wednesday to be bored to death in her
      salon with a crowd of affected, simpering women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not say that those same Wednesdays of Madame Fromont&rsquo;s were very
      useful to her, that they were like a weekly journal of fashion, one of
      those composite little publications in which you are told how to enter and
      to leave a room, how to bow, how to place flowers in a jardiniere and
      cigars in a case, to say nothing of the engravings, the procession of
      graceful, faultlessly attired men and women, and the names of the best
      modistes. Nor did Sidonie add that she had entreated all those friends of
      Claire&rsquo;s, of whom she spoke so scornfully, to come to see her on her own
      day, and that the day was selected by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will they come? Will Madame Fromont Jeune insult Madame Risler Aine by
      absenting herself on her first Friday? The thought makes her almost
      feverish with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, hurry!&rdquo; she says again and again. &ldquo;Good heavens! how
      long you are at your, breakfast!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is a fact that it is one of honest Risler&rsquo;s ways to eat slowly, and to
      light his pipe at the table while he sips his coffee. To-day he must
      renounce these cherished habits, must leave the pipe in its case because
      of the smoke, and, as soon as he has swallowed the last mouthful, run
      hastily and dress, for his wife insists that he must come up during the
      afternoon and pay his respects to the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a sensation in the factory when they see Risler Aine come in, on a
      week-day, in a black frock-coat and white cravat!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to a wedding, pray?&rdquo; cries Sigismond, the cashier, behind
      his grating.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Risler, not without a feeling of pride, replies:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my wife&rsquo;s reception day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon everybody in the place knows that it is Sidonie&rsquo;s day; and Pere
      Achille, who takes care of the garden, is not very well pleased to find
      that the branches of the winter laurels by the gate are broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before taking his seat at the table upon which he draws, in the bright
      light from the tall windows, Risler has taken off his fine frock-coat,
      which embarrasses him, and has turned up his clean shirt-sleeves; but the
      idea that his wife is expecting company preoccupies and disturbs him; and
      from time to time he puts on his coat and goes up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has no one come?&rdquo; he asks timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Monsieur, no one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the beautiful red drawing-room&mdash;for they have a drawing-room in
      red damask, with a console between the windows and a pretty table in the
      centre of the light-flowered carpet&mdash;Sidonie has established herself
      in the attitude of a woman holding a reception, a circle of chairs of many
      shapes around her. Here and there are books, reviews, a little work-basket
      in the shape of a gamebag, with silk tassels, a bunch of violets in a
      glass vase, and green plants in the jardinieres. Everything is arranged
      exactly as in the Fromonts&rsquo; apartments on the floor below; but the taste,
      that invisible line which separates the distinguished from the vulgar, is
      not yet refined. You would say it was a passable copy of a pretty genre
      picture. The hostess&rsquo;s attire, even, is too new; she looks more as if she
      were making a call than as if she were at home. In Risler&rsquo;s eyes
      everything is superb, beyond reproach; he is preparing to say so as he
      enters the salon, but, in face of his wife&rsquo;s wrathful glance, he checks
      himself in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, it&rsquo;s four o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; she says, pointing to the clock with an
      angry gesture. &ldquo;No one will come. But I take it especially ill of Claire
      not to come up. She is at home&mdash;I am sure of it&mdash;I can hear
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, ever since noon, Sidonie has listened intently to the slightest
      sounds on the floor below, the child&rsquo;s crying, the closing of doors.
      Risler attempts to go down again in order to avoid a renewal of the
      conversation at breakfast; but his wife will not allow him to do so. The
      very least he can do is to stay with her when everybody else abandons her,
      and so he remains there, at a loss what to say, rooted to the spot, like
      those people who dare not move during a storm for fear of attracting the
      lightning. Sidonie moves excitedly about, going in and out of the salon,
      changing the position of a chair, putting it back again, looking at
      herself as she passes the mirror, and ringing for her maid to send her to
      ask Pere Achille if no one has inquired for her. That Pere Achille is such
      a spiteful creature! Perhaps when people have come, he has said that she
      was out.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no, the concierge has not seen any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence and consternation. Sidonie is standing at the window on the left,
      Risler at the one on the right. From there they can see the little garden,
      where the darkness is gathering, and the black smoke which the chimney
      emits beneath the lowering clouds. Sigismond&rsquo;s window is the first to show
      a light on the ground floor; the cashier trims his lamp himself with
      painstaking care, and his tall shadow passes in front of the flame and
      bends double behind the grating. Sidonie&rsquo;s wrath is diverted a moment by
      these familiar details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a small coupe drives into the garden and stops in front of the
      door. At last some one is coming. In that pretty whirl of silk and flowers
      and jet and flounces and furs, as it runs quickly up the step, Sidonie has
      recognized one of the most fashionable frequenters of the Fromont salon,
      the wife of a wealthy dealer in bronzes. What an honor to receive a call
      from such an one! Quick, quick! the family takes its position, Monsieur in
      front of the hearth, Madame in an easychair, carelessly turning the leaves
      of a magazine. Wasted pose! The fair caller did not come to see Sidonie;
      she has stopped at the floor below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! if Madame Georges could hear what her neighbor says of her and her
      friends!
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the door opens and &ldquo;Mademoiselle Planus&rdquo; is announced. She
      is the cashier&rsquo;s sister, a poor old maid, humble and modest, who has made
      it her duty to make this call upon the wife of her brother&rsquo;s employer, and
      who is amazed at the warm welcome she receives. She is surrounded and made
      much of. &ldquo;How kind of you to come! Draw up to the fire.&rdquo; They overwhelm
      her with attentions and show great interest in her slightest word. Honest
      Risler&rsquo;s smiles are as warm as his thanks. Sidonie herself displays all
      her fascinations, overjoyed to exhibit herself in her glory to one who was
      her equal in the old days, and to reflect that the other, in the room
      below, must hear that she has had callers. So she makes as much noise as
      possible, moving chairs, pushing the table around; and when the lady takes
      her leave, dazzled, enchanted, bewildered, she escorts her to the landing
      with a great rustling of flounces, and calls to her in a very loud voice,
      leaning over the rail, that she is at home every Friday. &ldquo;You understand,
      every Friday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now it is dark. The two great lamps in the salon are lighted. In the
      adjoining room they hear the servant laying the table. It is all over.
      Madame Fromont Jeune will not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidonie is pale with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just fancy, that minx can&rsquo;t come up eighteen steps! No doubt Madame
      thinks we&rsquo;re not grand enough for her. Ah! but I&rsquo;ll have my revenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she pours forth her wrath in unjust words, her voice becomes coarse,
      takes on the intonations of the faubourg, an accent of the common people
      which betrays the ex-apprentice of Mademoiselle Le Mire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler is unlucky enough to make a remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows? Perhaps the child is ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turns upon him in a fury, as if she would like to bite him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you hold your tongue about that brat? After all, it&rsquo;s your fault
      that this has happened to me. You don&rsquo;t know how to make people treat me
      with respect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as she closed the door of her bedroom violently, making the globes on
      the lamps tremble, as well as all the knick-knacks on the etageres,
      Risler, left alone, stands motionless in the centre of the salon, looking
      with an air of consternation at his white cuffs, his broad patent-leather
      shoes, and mutters mechanically:

      CHAPTER VII. THE TRUE PEARL AND THE FALSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can be the matter? What have I done to her?&rdquo; Claire Fromont very
      often wondered when she thought of Sidonie.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was entirely ignorant of what had formerly taken place between her
      friend and Georges at Savigny. Her own life was so upright, her mind so
      pure, that it was impossible for her to divine the jealous, mean-spirited
      ambition that had grown up by her side within the past fifteen years. And
      yet the enigmatical expression in that pretty face as it smiled upon her
      gave her a vague feeling of uneasiness which she could not understand. An
      affectation of politeness, strange enough between friends, was suddenly
      succeeded by an ill-dissembled anger, a cold, stinging tone, in presence
      of which Claire was as perplexed as by a difficult problem. Sometimes,
      too, a singular presentiment, the ill-defined intuition of a great
      misfortune, was mingled with her uneasiness; for all women have in some
      degree a kind of second sight, and, even in the most innocent, ignorance
      of evil is suddenly illumined by visions of extraordinary lucidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time, as the result of a conversation somewhat longer than
      usual, or of one of those unexpected meetings when faces taken by surprise
      allow their real thoughts to be seen, Madame Fromont reflected seriously
      concerning this strange little Sidonie; but the active, urgent duties of
      life, with its accompaniment of affections and preoccupations, left her no
      time for dwelling upon such trifles.
    </p>
    <p>
      To all women comes a time when they encounter such sudden windings in the
      road that their whole horizon changes and all their points of view become
      transformed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Claire been a young girl, the falling away of that friendship bit by
      bit, as if torn from her by an unkindly hand, would have been a source of
      great regret to her. But she had lost her father, the object of her
      greatest, her only youthful affection; then she had married. The child had
      come, with its thrice welcome demands upon her every moment. Moreover, she
      had with her her mother, almost in her dotage, still stupefied by her
      husband&rsquo;s tragic death. In a life so fully occupied, Sidonie&rsquo;s caprices
      received but little attention; and it had hardly occurred to Claire
      Fromont to be surprised at her marriage to Risler. He was clearly too old
      for her; but, after all, what difference did it make, if they loved each
      other?
    </p>
    <p>
      As for being vexed because little Chebe had attained that lofty position,
      had become almost her equal, her superior nature was incapable of such
      pettiness. On the contrary, she would have been glad with all her heart to
      know that that young wife, whose home was so near her own, who lived the
      same life, so to speak, and had been her playmate in childhood, was happy
      and highly esteemed. Being most kindly disposed toward her, she tried to
      teach her, to instruct her in the ways of society, as one might instruct
      an attractive provincial, who fell but little short of being altogether
      charming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advice is not readily accepted by one pretty young woman from another.
      When Madame Fromont gave a grand dinner-party, she took Madame Risler to
      her bedroom, and said to her, smiling frankly in order not to vex her:
      &ldquo;You have put on too many jewels, my dear. And then, you know, with a high
      dress one doesn&rsquo;t wear flowers in the hair.&rdquo; Sidonie blushed, and thanked
      her friend, but wrote down an additional grievance against her in the
      bottom of her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Claire&rsquo;s circle her welcome was decidedly cold. The Faubourg
      Saint-Germain has its pretensions; but do not imagine that the Marais has
      none! Those wives and daughters of mechanics, of wealthy manufacturers,
      knew little Chebe&rsquo;s story; indeed, they would have guessed it simply by
      her manner of making her appearance and by her demeanor among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidonie&rsquo;s efforts were unavailing. She retained the manners of a
      shop-girl. Her slightly artificial amiability, sometimes too humble, was
      as unpleasant as the spurious elegance of the shop; and her disdainful
      attitudes recalled the superb airs of the head saleswomen in the great
      dry-goods establishments, arrayed in black silk gowns, which they take off
      in the dressing-room when they go away at night&mdash;who stare with an
      imposing air, from the vantage-point of their mountains of curls, at the
      poor creatures who venture to discuss prices.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt that she was being examined and criticised, and her modesty was
      compelled to place itself upon a war footing. Of the names mentioned in
      her presence, the amusements, the entertainments, the books of which they
      talked to her, she knew nothing. Claire did her best to help her, to keep
      her on the surface, with a friendly hand always outstretched; but many of
      these ladies thought Sidonie pretty; that was enough to make them bear her
      a grudge for seeking admission to their circle. Others, proud of their
      husbands&rsquo; standing and of their wealth, could not invent enough unspoken
      affronts and patronizing phrases to humiliate the little parvenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidonie included them all in a single phrase: &ldquo;Claire&rsquo;s friends&mdash;that
      is to say, my enemies!&rdquo; But she was seriously incensed against but one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two partners had no suspicion of what was taking place between their
      wives. Risler, continually engrossed in his press, sometimes remained at
      his draughting-table until midnight. Fromont passed his days abroad,
      lunched at his club, was almost never at the factory. He had his reasons
      for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidonie&rsquo;s proximity disturbed him. His capricious passion for her, that
      passion that he had sacrificed to his uncle&rsquo;s last wishes, recurred too
      often to his memory with all the regret one feels for the irreparable;
      and, conscious that he was weak, he fled. His was a pliable nature,
      without sustaining purpose, intelligent enough to appreciate his failings,
      too weak to guide itself. On the evening of Risler&rsquo;s wedding&mdash;he had
      been married but a few months himself&mdash;he had experienced anew, in
      that woman&rsquo;s presence, all the emotion of the stormy evening at Savigny.
      Thereafter, without self-examination, he avoided seeing her again or
      speaking with her. Unfortunately, as they lived in the same house, as
      their wives saw each other ten times a day, chance sometimes brought them
      together; and this strange thing happened&mdash;that the husband, wishing
      to remain virtuous, deserted his home altogether and sought distraction
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire was not astonished that it was so. She had become accustomed,
      during her father&rsquo;s lifetime, to the constant comings and goings of a
      business life; and during her husband&rsquo;s absences, zealously performing her
      duties as wife and mother, she invented long tasks, occupations of all
      sorts, walks for the child, prolonged, peaceful tarryings in the sunlight,
      from which she would return home, overjoyed with the little one&rsquo;s
      progress, deeply impressed with the gleeful enjoyment of all infants in
      the fresh air, but with a touch of their radiance in the depths of her
      serious eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidonie also went out a great deal. It often happened, toward night, that
      Georges&rsquo;s carriage, driving through the gateway, would compel Madame
      Risler to step hastily aside as she was returning in a gorgeous costume
      from a triumphal promenade. The boulevard, the shop-windows, the
      purchases, made after long deliberation as if to enjoy to the full the
      pleasure of purchasing, detained her very late. They would exchange a bow,
      a cold glance at the foot of the staircase; and Georges would hurry into
      his apartments, as into a place of refuge, concealing beneath a flood of
      caresses, bestowed upon the child his wife held out to him, the sudden
      emotion that had seized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidonie, for her part, seemed to have forgotten everything, and to have
      retained no other feeling but contempt for that weak, cowardly creature.
      Moreover, she had many other things to think about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband had just had a piano placed in her red salon, between the
      windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      After long hesitation she had decided to learn to sing, thinking that it
      was rather late to begin to play the piano; and twice a week Madame
      Dobson, a pretty, sentimental blonde, came to give her lessons from twelve
      o&rsquo;clock to one. In the silence of the neighborhood the a-a-a and o-oo,
      persistently prolonged, repeated again and again, with windows open, gave
      the factory the atmosphere of a boarding-school.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was in reality a schoolgirl who was practising these exercises, an
      inexperienced, wavering little soul, full of unconfessed longings, with
      everything to learn and to find out in order to become a real woman. But
      her ambition confined itself to a superficial aspect of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Claire Fromont plays the piano; I will sing. She is considered a refined
      and distinguished woman, and I intend that people shall say the same of
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a thought of improving her education, Sidonie passed her life
      running about among milliners and dressmakers. &ldquo;What are people going to
      wear this winter?&rdquo; was her cry. She was attracted by the gorgeous displays
      in the shop-windows, by everything that caught the eye of the passers-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one thing that Sidonie envied Claire more than all else was the child,
      the luxurious plaything, beribboned from the curtains of its cradle to its
      nurse&rsquo;s cap. She did not think of the sweet, maternal duties, demanding
      patience and self-abnegation, of the long rockings when sleep would not
      come, of the laughing awakenings sparkling with fresh water. No! she saw
      in the child naught but the daily walk. It is such a pretty sight, the
      little bundle of finery, with floating ribbons and long feathers, that
      follows young mothers through the crowded streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she wanted company she had only her parents or her husband. She
      preferred to go out alone. The excellent Risler had such an absurd way of
      showing his love for her, playing with her as if she were a doll, pinching
      her chin and her cheek, capering about her, crying, &ldquo;Hou! hou!&rdquo; or staring
      at her with his great, soft eyes like an affectionate and grateful dog.
      That senseless love, which made of her a toy, a mantel ornament, made her
      ashamed. As for her parents, they were an embarrassment to her in presence
      of the people she wished to know, and immediately after her marriage she
      almost got rid of them by hiring a little house for them at Montrouge.
      That step had cut short the frequent invasions of Monsieur Chebe and his
      long frock-coat, and the endless visits of good Madame Chebe, in whom the
      return of comfortable circumstances had revived former habits of gossip
      and of indolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidonie would have been very glad to rid herself of the Delobelles in the
      same way, for their proximity annoyed her. But the Marais was a central
      location for the old actor, because the boulevard theatres were so near;
      then, too, Desiree, like all sedentary persons, clung to the familiar
      outlook, and her gloomy courtyard, dark at four o&rsquo;clock in winter, seemed
      to her like a friend, like a familiar face which the sun lighted up at
      times as if it were smiling at her. As she was unable to get rid of them,
      Sidonie had adopted the course of ceasing to visit them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, her life would have been lonely and depressing enough, had it
      not been for the distractions which Claire Fromont procured for her. Each
      time added fuel to her wrath. She would say to herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must everything come to me through her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when, just at dinner-time, a box at the theatre or an invitation for
      the evening was sent to her from the floor below, while she was dressing,
      overjoyed at the opportunity to exhibit herself, she thought of nothing
      but crushing her rival. But such opportunities became more rare as
      Claire&rsquo;s time was more and more engrossed by her child. When Grandfather
      Gardinois came to Paris, however, he never failed to bring the two
      families together. The old peasant&rsquo;s gayety, for its freer expansion,
      needed little Sidonie, who did not take alarm at his jests. He would take
      them all four to dine at Philippe&rsquo;s, his favorite restaurant, where he
      knew all the patrons, the waiters and the steward, would spend a lot of
      money, and then take them to a reserved box at the Opera-Comique or the
      Palais-Royal.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the theatre he laughed uproariously, talked familiarly with the
      box-openers, as he did with the waiters at Philippe&rsquo;s, loudly demanded
      footstools for the ladies, and when the performance was over insisted on
      having the topcoats and fur wraps of his party first of all, as if he were
      the only three-million parvenu in the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      For these somewhat vulgar entertainments, from which her husband usually
      excused himself, Claire, with her usual tact, dressed very plainly and
      attracted no attention. Sidonie, on the contrary, in all her finery, in
      full view of the boxes, laughed with all her heart at the grandfather&rsquo;s
      anecdotes, happy to have descended from the second or third gallery, her
      usual place in the old days, to that lovely proscenium box, adorned with
      mirrors, with a velvet rail that seemed made expressly for her light
      gloves, her ivory opera-glass, and her spangled fan. The tawdry glitter of
      the theatre, the red and gold of the hangings, were genuine splendor to
      her. She bloomed among them like a pretty paper flower in a filigree
      jardiniere.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, at the performance of a successful play at the Palais-Royal,
      among all the noted women who were present, painted celebrities wearing
      microscopic hats and armed with huge fans, their rouge-besmeared faces
      standing out from the shadow of the boxes in the gaudy setting of their
      gowns, Sidonie&rsquo;s behavior, her toilette, the peculiarities of her laugh
      and her expression attracted much attention. All the opera-glasses in the
      hall, guided by the magnetic current that is so powerful under the great
      chandeliers, were turned one by one upon the box in which she sat. Claire
      soon became embarrassed, and modestly insisted upon changing places with
      her husband, who, unluckily, had accompanied them that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georges, youthful and elegant, sitting beside Sidonie, seemed her natural
      companion, while Risler Allie, always so placid and self-effacing, seemed
      in his proper place beside Claire Fromont, who in her dark clothes
      suggested the respectable woman incog. at the Bal de l&rsquo;Opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon leaving the theatre each of the partners offered his arm to his
      neighbor. A box-opener, speaking to Sidonie, referred to Georges as &ldquo;your
      husband,&rdquo; and the little woman beamed with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That simple phrase was enough to upset her and set in motion a multitude
      of evil currents in the depths of her heart. As they passed through the
      corridors and the foyer, she watched Risler and Madame &ldquo;Chorche&rdquo; walking
      in front of them. Claire&rsquo;s refinement of manner seemed to her to be
      vulgarized and annihilated by Risler&rsquo;s shuffling gait. &ldquo;How ugly he must
      make me look when we are walking together!&rdquo; she said to herself. And her
      heart beat fast as she thought what a charming, happy, admired couple they
      would have made, she and this Georges Fromont, whose arm was trembling
      beneath her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, when the blue-lined carriage drove up to the door of the
      theatre, she began to reflect, for the first time, that, when all was
      said, Claire had stolen her place and that she would be justified in
      trying to recover it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. THE BREWERY ON THE RUE BLONDEL
    </h2>
    <p>
      After his marriage Risler had given up the brewery. Sidonie would have
      been glad to have him leave the house in the evening for a fashionable
      club, a resort of wealthy, well-dressed men; but the idea of his
      returning, amid clouds of pipe-smoke, to his friends of earlier days,
      Sigismond, Delobelle, and her own father, humiliated her and made her
      unhappy. So he ceased to frequent the place; and that was something of a
      sacrifice. It was almost a glimpse of his native country, that brewery
      situated in a remote corner of Paris. The infrequent carriages, the high,
      barred windows of the ground floors, the odor of fresh drugs, of
      pharmaceutical preparations, imparted to that narrow little Rue Blondel a
      vague resemblance to certain streets in Basle or Zurich.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brewery was managed by a Swiss and crowded with men of that
      nationality. When the door was opened, through the smoke-laden atmosphere,
      dense with the accents of the North, one had a vision of a vast, low room
      with hams hanging from the rafters, casks of beer standing in a row, the
      floor ankle-deep with sawdust, and on the counter great salad-bowls filled
      with potatoes as red as chestnuts, and baskets of pretzels fresh from the
      oven, their golden knots sprinkled with white salt.
    </p>
    <p>
      For twenty years Risler had had his pipe there, a long pipe marked with
      his name in the rack reserved for the regular customers. He had also his
      table, at which he was always joined by several discreet, quiet
      compatriots, who listened admiringly, but without comprehending them, to
      the endless harangues of Chebe and Delobelle. When Risler ceased his
      visits to the brewery, the two last-named worthies likewise turned their
      backs upon it, for several excellent reasons. In the first place, M. Chebe
      now lived a considerable distance away. Thanks to the generosity of his
      children, the dream of his whole life was realized at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I am rich,&rdquo; the little man used to say in his cheerless rooms in the
      Marais, &ldquo;I will have a house of my own, at the gates of Paris, almost in
      the country, a little garden which I will plant and water myself. That
      will be better for my health than all the excitement of the capital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, he had his house now, but he did not enjoy himself in it. It was at
      Montrouge, on the road that runs around the city. &ldquo;A small chalet, with
      garden,&rdquo; said the advertisement, printed on a placard which gave an almost
      exact idea of the dimensions of the property. The papers were new and of
      rustic design, the paint perfectly fresh; a water-butt planted beside a
      vine-clad arbor played the part of a pond. In addition to all these
      advantages, only a hedge separated this paradise from another &ldquo;chalet with
      garden&rdquo; of precisely the same description, occupied by Sigismond Planus
      the cashier, and his sister. To Madame Chebe that was a most precious
      circumstance. When the good woman was bored, she would take a stock of
      knitting and darning and go and sit in the old maid&rsquo;s arbor, dazzling her
      with the tale of her past splendors. Unluckily, her husband had not the
      same source of distraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, everything went well at first. It was midsummer, and M. Chebe,
      always in his shirt-sleeves, was busily employed in getting settled. Each
      nail to be driven in the house was the subject of leisurely reflections,
      of endless discussions. It was the same with the garden. He had determined
      at first to make an English garden of it, lawns always green, winding
      paths shaded by shrubbery. But the trouble of it was that it took so long
      for the shrubbery to grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a mind to make an orchard of it,&rdquo; said the impatient little man.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thenceforth he dreamed of nothing but vegetables, long lines of beans,
      and peach-trees against the wall. He dug for whole mornings, knitting his
      brows in a preoccupied way and wiping his forehead ostentatiously before
      his wife, so that she would say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, do rest a bit&mdash;you&rsquo;re killing yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The result was that the garden was a mixture: flowers and fruit, park and
      kitchen garden; and whenever he went into Paris M. Chebe was careful to
      decorate his buttonhole with a rose from his rose-bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the fine weather lasted, the good people did not weary of admiring
      the sunsets behind the fortifications, the long days, the bracing country
      air. Sometimes, in the evening, when the windows were open, they sang
      duets; and in presence of the stars in heaven, which began to twinkle
      simultaneously with the lanterns on the railway around the city, Ferdinand
      would become poetical. But when the rain came and he could not go out,
      what misery! Madame Chebe, a thorough Parisian, sighed for the narrow
      streets of the Marais, her expeditions to the market of Blancs-Manteaux,
      and to the shops of the quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she sat by the window, her usual place for sewing and observation, she
      would gaze at the damp little garden, where the volubilis and the
      nasturtiums, stripped of their blossoms, were dropping away from the
      lattices with an air of exhaustion, at the long, straight line of the
      grassy slope of the fortifications, still fresh and green, and, a little
      farther on, at the corner of a street, the office of the Paris omnibuses,
      with all the points of their route inscribed in enticing letters on the
      green walls. Whenever one of the omnibuses lumbered away on its journey,
      she followed it with her eyes, as a government clerk at Cayenne or Noumea
      gazes after the steamer about to return to France; she made the trip with
      it, knew just where it would stop, at what point it would lurch around a
      corner, grazing the shop-windows with its wheels.

      As a prisoner, M. Chebe became a terrible trial. He could not work in the
      garden. On Sundays the fortifications were deserted; he could no longer
      strut about among the workingmen&rsquo;s families dining on the grass, and pass
      from group to group in a neighborly way, his feet encased in embroidered
      slippers, with the authoritative demeanor of a wealthy landowner of the
      vicinity. This he missed more than anything else, consumed as he was by
      the desire to make people think about him. So that, having nothing to do,
      having no one to pose before, no one to listen to his schemes, his
      stories, the anecdote of the accident to the Duc d&rsquo;Orleans&mdash;a similar
      accident had happened to him in his youth, you remember&mdash;the
      unfortunate Ferdinand overwhelmed his wife with reproaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your daughter banishes us&mdash;your daughter is ashamed of us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She heard nothing but that &ldquo;Your daughter&mdash;your daughter&mdash;your
      daughter!&rdquo; For, in his anger with Sidonie, he denied her, throwing upon
      his wife the whole responsibility for that monstrous and unnatural child.
      It was a genuine relief for poor Madame Chebe when her husband took an
      omnibus at the office to go and hunt up Delobelle&mdash;whose hours for
      lounging were always at his disposal&mdash;and pour into his bosom all his
      rancor against his son-in-law and his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The illustrious Delobelle also bore Risler a grudge, and freely said of
      him: &ldquo;He is a dastard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The great man had hoped to form an integral part of the new household, to
      be the organizer of festivities, the &lsquo;arbiter elegantiarum&rsquo;. Instead of
      which, Sidonie received him very coldly, and Risler no longer even took
      him to the brewery. However, the actor did not complain too loud, and
      whenever he met his friend he overwhelmed him with attentions and
      flattery; for he had need of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weary of awaiting the discerning manager, seeing that the engagement he
      had longed for so many years did not come, it had occurred to Delobelle to
      purchase a theatre and manage it himself. He counted upon Risler for the
      funds. Opportunely enough, a small theatre on the boulevard happened to be
      for sale, as a result of the failure of its manager. Delobelle mentioned
      it to Risler, at first very vaguely, in a wholly hypothetical form&mdash;&ldquo;There
      would be a good chance to make a fine stroke.&rdquo; Risler listened with his
      usual phlegm, saying, &ldquo;Indeed, it would be a good thing for you.&rdquo; And to a
      more direct suggestion, not daring to answer, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he took refuge behind
      such phrases as &ldquo;I will see&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Perhaps later&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say no&rdquo;&mdash;and
      finally uttered the unlucky words &ldquo;I must see the estimates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a whole week the actor had delved away at plans and figures, seated
      between his wife and daughter, who watched him in admiration, and
      intoxicated themselves with this latest dream. The people in the house
      said, &ldquo;Monsieur Delobelle is going to buy a theatre.&rdquo; On the boulevard, in
      the actors&rsquo; cafes, nothing was talked of but this transaction. Delobelle
      did not conceal the fact that he had found some one to advance the funds;
      the result being that he was surrounded by a crowd of unemployed actors,
      old comrades who tapped him familiarly on the shoulder and recalled
      themselves to his recollection&mdash;&ldquo;You know, old boy.&rdquo; He promised
      engagements, breakfasted at the cafe, wrote letters there, greeted those
      who entered with the tips of his fingers, held very animated conversations
      in corners; and already two threadbare authors had read to him a drama in
      seven tableaux, which was &ldquo;exactly what he wanted&rdquo; for his opening piece.
      He talked about &ldquo;my theatre!&rdquo; and his letters were addressed, &ldquo;Monsieur
      Delobelle, Manager.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had composed his prospectus and made his estimates, he went to the
      factory to see Risler, who, being very busy, made an appointment to meet
      him in the Rue Blondel; and that same evening, Delobelle, being the first
      to arrive at the brewery, established himself at their old table, ordered
      a pitcher of beer and two glasses, and waited. He waited a long while,
      with his eye on the door, trembling with impatience. Whenever any one
      entered, the actor turned his head. He had spread his papers on the table,
      and pretended to be reading them, with animated gestures and movements of
      the head and lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a magnificent opportunity, unique in its way. He already fancied
      himself acting&mdash;for that was the main point&mdash;acting, in a
      theatre of his own, roles written expressly for him, to suit his talents,
      in which he would produce all the effect of&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the door opened, and M. Chebe made his appearance amid the
      pipe-smoke. He was as surprised and annoyed to find Delobelle there as
      Delobelle himself was by his coming. He had written to his son-in-law that
      morning that he wished to speak with him on a matter of very serious
      importance, and that he would meet him at the brewery. It was an affair of
      honor, entirely between themselves, from man to man. The real fact
      concerning this affair of honor was that M. Chebe had given notice of his
      intention to leave the little house at Montrouge, and had hired a shop
      with an entresol in the Rue du Mail, in the midst of a business district.
      A shop? Yes, indeed! And now he was a little alarmed regarding his hasty
      step, anxious to know how his son-in-law would take it, especially as the
      shop cost much more than the Montrouge house, and there were some repairs
      to be made at the outset. As he had long been acquainted with his
      son-in-law&rsquo;s kindness of heart, M. Chebe had determined to appeal to him
      at once, hoping to lead him into his game and throw upon him the
      responsibility for this domestic change. Instead of Risler he found
      Delobelle.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked askance at each other, with an unfriendly eye, like two dogs
      meeting beside the same dish. Each divined for whom the other was waiting,
      and they did not try to deceive each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t my son-in-law here?&rdquo; asked M. Chebe, eying the documents spread
      over the table, and emphasizing the words &ldquo;my son-in-law,&rdquo; to indicate
      that Risler belonged to him and to nobody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am waiting for him,&rdquo; Delobelle replied, gathering up his papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed his lips together, as he added with a dignified, mysterious,
      but always theatrical air:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a matter of very great importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So is mine,&rdquo; declared M. Chebe, his three hairs standing erect like a
      porcupine&rsquo;s quills.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he took his seat on the bench beside Delobelle, ordered a
      pitcher and two glasses as the former had done, then sat erect with his
      hands in his pockets and his back against the wall, waiting in his turn.
      The two empty glasses in front of them, intended for the same absentee,
      seemed to be hurling defiance at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Risler did not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men, drinking in silence, lost their patience and fidgeted about
      on the bench, each hoping that the other would tire of waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last their ill-humor overflowed, and naturally poor Risler received the
      whole flood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an outrage to keep a man of my years waiting so long!&rdquo; began M.
      Chebe, who never mentioned his great age except upon such occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe, on my word, that he is making sport of us,&rdquo; replied M.
      Delobelle.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the other:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt Monsieur had company to dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And such company!&rdquo; scornfully exclaimed the illustrious actor, in whose
      mind bitter memories were awakened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is&mdash;&rdquo; continued M. Chebe.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drew closer to each other and talked. The hearts of both were full in
      respect to Sidonie and Risler. They opened the flood-gates. That Risler,
      with all his good-nature, was an egotist pure and simple, a parvenu. They
      laughed at his accent and his bearing, they mimicked certain of his
      peculiarities. Then they talked about his household, and, lowering their
      voices, they became confidential, laughed familiarly together, were
      friends once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Chebe went very far: &ldquo;Let him beware! he has been foolish enough to
      send the father and mother away from their daughter; if anything happens
      to her, he can&rsquo;t blame us. A girl who hasn&rsquo;t her parents&rsquo; example before
      her eyes, you understand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly&mdash;certainly,&rdquo; said Delobelle; &ldquo;especially as Sidonie has
      become a great flirt. However, what can you expect? He will get no more
      than he deserves. No man of his age ought to&mdash;Hush! here he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Risler had entered the room, and was walking toward them, distributing
      hand-shakes all along the benches.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment of embarrassment between the three friends. Risler
      excused himself as well as he could. He had been detained at home; Sidonie
      had company&mdash;Delobelle touched M. Chebe&rsquo;s foot under the table&mdash;and,
      as he spoke, the poor man, decidedly perplexed by the two empty glasses
      that awaited him, wondered in front of which of the two he ought to take
      his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delobelle was generous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have business together, Messieurs; do not let me disturb you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He added in a low tone, winking at Risler:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The papers?&rdquo; echoed Risler, in a bewildered tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The estimates,&rdquo; whispered the actor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, with a great show of discretion, he withdrew within himself,
      and resumed the reading of his documents, his head in his hands and his
      fingers in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two others conversed by his side, first in undertones, then louder,
      for M. Chebe&rsquo;s shrill, piercing voice could not long be subdued.&mdash;He
      wasn&rsquo;t old enough to be buried, deuce take it!&mdash;He should have died
      of ennui at Montrouge.&mdash;What he must have was the bustle and life of
      the Rue de Mail or the Rue du Sentier&mdash;of the business districts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but a shop? Why a shop?&rdquo; Risler timidly ventured to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why a shop?&mdash;why a shop?&rdquo; repeated M. Chebe, red as an Easter egg,
      and raising his voice to its highest pitch. &ldquo;Why, because I&rsquo;m a merchant,
      Monsieur Risler, a merchant and son of a merchant. Oh! I see what you&rsquo;re
      coming at. I have no business. But whose fault is it? If the people who
      shut me up at Montrouge, at the gates of Bicetre, like a paralytic, had
      had the good sense to furnish me with the money to start in business&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that point Risler succeeded in silencing him, and thereafter only
      snatches of the conversation could be heard: &ldquo;a more convenient shop&mdash;high
      ceilings&mdash;better air&mdash;future plans&mdash;enormous business&mdash;I
      will speak when the time comes&mdash;many people will be astonished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he caught these fragments of sentences, Delobelle became more and more
      absorbed in his estimates, presenting the eloquent back of the man who is
      not listening. Risler, sorely perplexed, slowly sipped his beer from time
      to time to keep himself, in countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, when M. Chebe had grown calm, and with good reason, his
      son-in-law turned with a smile to the illustrious Delobelle, and met the
      stern, impassive glance which seemed to say, &ldquo;Well! what of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Mon Dieu!&mdash;that is true,&rdquo; thought the poor fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Changing at once his chair and his glass, he took his seat opposite the
      actor. But M. Chebe had not Delobelle&rsquo;s courtesy. Instead of discreetly
      moving away, he took his glass and joined the others, so that the great
      man, unwilling to speak before him, solemnly replaced his documents in his
      pocket a second time, saying to Risler:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will talk this over later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very much later, in truth, for M. Chebe had reflected:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son-in-law is so good-natured! If I leave him with this swindler, who
      knows what he may get out of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he remained on guard. The actor was furious. It was impossible to
      postpone the matter to some other day, for Risler told them that he was
      going the next day to spend the next month at Savigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A month at Savigny!&rdquo; exclaimed M. Chebe, incensed at the thought of his
      son-in-law escaping him. &ldquo;How about business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I shall come to Paris every day with Georges. Monsieur Gardinois is
      very anxious to see his little Sidonie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Chebe shook his head. He considered it very imprudent. Business is
      business. A man ought to be on the spot, always on the spot, in the
      breach. Who could say?&mdash;the factory might take fire in the night. And
      he repeated sententiously: &ldquo;The eye of the master, my dear fellow, the eye
      of the master,&rdquo; while the actor&mdash;who was little better pleased by
      this intended departure&mdash;opened his great eyes; giving them an
      expression at once cunning and authoritative, the veritable expression of
      the eye of the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, about midnight, the last Montrouge omnibus bore away the
      tyrannical father-in-law, and Delobelle was able to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us first look at the prospectus,&rdquo; he said, preferring not to attack
      the question of figures at once; and with his eyeglasses on his nose, he
      began, in a declamatory tone, always upon the stage: &ldquo;When one considers
      coolly the decrepitude which dramatic art has reached in France, when one
      measures the distance that separates the stage of Moliere&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were several pages like that. Risler listened, puffing at his pipe,
      afraid to stir, for the reader looked at him every moment over his
      eyeglasses, to watch the effect of his phrases. Unfortunately, right in
      the middle of the prospectus, the cafe closed. The lights were
      extinguished; they must go.&mdash;And the estimates?&mdash;It was agreed
      that they should read them as they walked along. They stopped at every
      gaslight. The actor displayed his figures. So much for the hall, so much
      for the lighting, so much for poor-rates, so much for the actors. On that
      question of the actors he was firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best point about the affair,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is that we shall have no
      leading man to pay. Our leading man will be Bibi.&rdquo; (When Delobelle
      mentioned himself, he commonly called himself Bibi.) &ldquo;A leading man is
      paid twenty thousand francs, and as we have none to pay, it&rsquo;s just as if
      you put twenty thousand francs in your pocket. Tell me, isn&rsquo;t that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Risler did not reply. He had the constrained manner, the wandering eyes of
      the man whose thoughts are elsewhere. The reading of the estimates being
      concluded, Delobelle, dismayed to find that they were drawing near the
      corner of the Rue des Vieilles-Haudriettes, put the question squarely.
      Would Risler advance the money, yes or no?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&mdash;no,&rdquo; said Risler, inspired by heroic courage, which he owed
      principally to the proximity of the factory and to the thought that the
      welfare of his family was at stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delobelle was astounded. He had believed that the business was as good as
      done, and he stared at his companion, intensely agitated, his eyes as big
      as saucers, and rolling his papers in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Risler continued, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do what you ask, for this reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the worthy man, slowly, with his usual heaviness of speech,
      explained that he was not rich. Although a partner in a wealthy house, he
      had no available funds. Georges and he drew a certain sum from the concern
      each month; then, when they struck a balance at the end of the year they
      divided the profits. It had cost him a good deal to begin housekeeping:
      all his savings. It was still four months before the inventory. Where was
      he to obtain the 30,000 francs to be paid down at once for the theatre?
      And then, beyond all that, the affair could not be successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it must succeed. Bibi will be there!&rdquo; As he spoke, poor Bibi drew
      himself up to his full height; but Risler was determined, and all Bibi&rsquo;s
      arguments met the same refusal&mdash;&ldquo;Later, in two or three years, I
      don&rsquo;t say something may not be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The actor fought for a long time, yielding his ground inch by inch. He
      proposed revising his estimates. The thing might be done cheaper. &ldquo;It
      would still be too dear for me,&rdquo; Risler interrupted. &ldquo;My name doesn&rsquo;t
      belong to me. It is a part of the firm. I have no right to pledge it.
      Imagine my going into bankruptcy!&rdquo; His voice trembled as he uttered the
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if everything is in my name,&rdquo; said Delobelle, who had no
      superstition. He tried everything, invoked the sacred interests of art,
      went so far as to mention the fascinating actresses whose alluring glances&mdash;Risler
      laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, you rascal! What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re saying? You forget that we&rsquo;re
      both married men, and that it is very late and our wives are expecting us.
      No ill-will, eh?&mdash;This is not a refusal, you understand.&mdash;By the
      way, come and see me after the inventory. We will talk it over again. Ah!
      there&rsquo;s Pere Achille putting out his gas.&mdash;I must go in. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was after one o&rsquo;clock when the actor returned home. The two women were
      waiting for him, working as usual, but with a sort of feverish activity
      which was strange to them. Every moment the great scissors that Mamma
      Delobelle used to cut the brass wire were seized with strange fits of
      trembling, and Desiree&rsquo;s little fingers, as she mounted an insect, moved
      so fast that it made one dizzy to watch them. Even the long feathers of
      the little birds scattered about on the table before her seemed more
      brilliant, more richly colored, than on other days. It was because a
      lovely visitor named Hope had called upon them that evening. She had made
      the tremendous effort required to climb five dark flights of stairs, and
      had opened the door of the little room to cast a luminous glance therein.
      However much you may have been deceived in life, those magic gleams always
      dazzle you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if your father could only succeed!&rdquo; said Mamma Delobelle from time to
      time, as if to sum up a whole world of happy thoughts to which her reverie
      abandoned itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will succeed, mamma, never fear. Monsieur Risler is so kind, I will
      answer for him. And Sidonie is very fond of us, too, although since she
      was married she does seem to neglect her old friends a little. But we must
      make allowance for the difference in our positions. Besides, I never shall
      forget what she did for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, at the thought of what Sidonie had done for her, the little cripple
      applied herself with even more feverish energy to her work. Her
      electrified fingers moved with redoubled swiftness. You would have said
      that they were running after some fleeing, elusive thing, like happiness,
      for example, or the love of some one who loves you not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it that she did for you?&rdquo; her mother would naturally have asked
      her; but at that moment she was only slightly interested in what her
      daughter said. She was thinking exclusively of her great man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! do you think so, my dear? Just suppose your father should have a
      theatre of his own and act again as in former days. You don&rsquo;t remember;
      you were too small then. But he had tremendous success, no end of recalls.
      One night, at Alencon, the subscribers to the theatre gave him a gold
      wreath. Ah! he was a brilliant man in those days, so lighthearted, so glad
      to be alive. Those who see him now don&rsquo;t know him, poor man, misfortune
      has changed him so. Oh, well! I feel sure that all that&rsquo;s necessary is a
      little success to make him young and happy again. And then there&rsquo;s money
      to be made managing theatres. The manager at Nantes had a carriage. Can
      you imagine us with a carriage? Can you imagine it, I say? That&rsquo;s what
      would be good for you. You could go out, leave your armchair once in a
      while. Your father would take us into the country. You would see the water
      and the trees you have had such a longing to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the trees,&rdquo; murmured the pale little recluse, trembling from head to
      foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the street door of the house was closed violently, and M.
      Delobelle&rsquo;s measured step echoed in the vestibule. There was a moment of
      speechless, breathless anguish. The women dared not look at each other,
      and mamma&rsquo;s great scissors trembled so that they cut the wire crooked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor devil had unquestionably received a terrible blow. His illusions
      crushed, the humiliation of a refusal, the jests of his comrades, the bill
      at the cafe where he had breakfasted on credit during the whole period of
      his managership, a bill which must be paid&mdash;all these things occurred
      to him in the silence and gloom of the five flights he had to climb. His
      heart was torn. Even so, the actor&rsquo;s nature was so strong in him that he
      deemed it his duty to envelop his distress, genuine as it was, in a
      conventional tragic mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he entered, he paused, cast an ominous glance around the work-room, at
      the table covered with work, his little supper waiting for him in a
      corner, and the two dear, anxious faces looking up at him with glistening
      eyes. He stood a full minute without speaking&mdash;and you know how long
      a minute&rsquo;s silence seems on the stage; then he took three steps forward,
      sank upon a low chair beside the table, and exclaimed in a hissing voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I am accursed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the same time he dealt the table such a terrible blow with his fist
      that the &ldquo;birds and insects for ornament&rdquo; flew to the four corners of the
      room. His terrified wife rose and timidly approached him, while Desiree
      half rose in her armchair with an expression of nervous agony that
      distorted all her features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lolling in his chair, his arms hanging despondently by his sides, his head
      on his chest, the actor soliloquized&mdash;a fragmentary soliloquy,
      interrupted by sighs and dramatic hiccoughs, overflowing with imprecations
      against the pitiless, selfish bourgeois, those monsters to whom the artist
      gives his flesh and blood for food and drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he reviewed his whole theatrical life, his early triumphs, the golden
      wreath from the subscribers at Alencon, his marriage to this &ldquo;sainted
      woman,&rdquo; and he pointed to the poor creature who stood by his side, with
      tears streaming from her eyes, and trembling lips, nodding her head
      dotingly at every word her husband said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In very truth, a person who never had heard of the illustrious Delobelle
      could have told his history in detail after that long monologue. He
      recalled his arrival in Paris, his humiliations, his privations. Alas! he
      was not the one who had known privation. One had but to look at his full,
      rotund face beside the thin, drawn faces of the two women. But the actor
      did not look so closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said, continuing to intoxicate himself with declamatory phrases,
      &ldquo;oh! to have struggled so long. For ten years, fifteen years, have I
      struggled on, supported by these devoted creatures, fed by them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, papa, hush,&rdquo; cried Desiree, clasping her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, fed by them, I say&mdash;and I do not blush for it. For I accept all
      this devotion in the name of sacred art. But this is too much. Too much
      has been put upon me. I renounce the stage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear, what is that you say?&rdquo; cried Mamma Delobelle, rushing to his
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, leave me. I have reached the end of my strength. They have slain the
      artist in me. It is all over. I renounce the stage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If you had seen the two women throw their arms about him then, implore him
      to struggle on, prove to him that he had no right to give up, you could
      not have restrained your tears. But Delobelle resisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He yielded at last, however, and promised to continue the fight a little
      while, since it was their wish; but it required many an entreaty and
      caress to carry the point.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. AT SAVIGNY
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a great misfortune, that sojourn of the two families at Savigny for
      a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an interval of two years Georges and Sidonie found themselves side
      by side once more on the old estate, too old not to be always like itself,
      where the stones, the ponds, the trees, always the same, seemed to cast
      derision upon all that changes and passes away. A renewal of intercourse
      under such circumstances must have been disastrous to two natures that
      were not of a very different stamp, and far more virtuous than those two.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Claire, she never had been so happy; Savigny never had seemed so
      lovely to her. What joy to walk with her child over the greensward where
      she herself had walked as a child; to sit, a young mother, upon the shaded
      seats from which her own mother had looked on at her childish games years
      before; to go, leaning on Georges&rsquo;s arm, to seek out the nooks where they
      had played together. She felt a tranquil contentment, the overflowing
      happiness of placid lives which enjoy their bliss in silence; and all day
      long her skirts swept along the paths, guided by the tiny footsteps of the
      child, her cries and her demands upon her mother&rsquo;s care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidonie seldom took part in these maternal promenades. She said that the
      chatter of children tired her, and therein she agreed with old Gardinois,
      who seized upon any pretext to annoy his granddaughter. He believed that
      he accomplished that object by devoting himself exclusively to Sidonie,
      and arranging even more entertainments for her than on her former visit.
      The carriages that had been shut up in the carriage-house for two years,
      and were dusted once a week because the spiders spun their webs on the
      silk cushions, were placed at her disposal. The horses were harnessed
      three times a day, and the gate was continually turning on its hinges.
      Everybody in the house followed this impulse of worldliness. The gardener
      paid more attention to his flowers because Madame Risler selected the
      finest ones to wear in her hair at dinner. And then there were calls to be
      made. Luncheon parties were given, gatherings at which Madame Fromont
      Jeune presided, but at which Sidonie, with her lively manners, shone
      supreme. Indeed, Claire often left her a clear field. The child had its
      hours for sleeping and riding out, with which no amusements could
      interfere. The mother was compelled to remain away, and it often happened
      that she was unable to go with Sidonie to meet the partners when they came
      from Paris at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will make my excuses,&rdquo; she would say, as the went up to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Risler was triumphant. A picture of elegant indolence, she would
      drive away behind the galloping horses, unconscious of the swiftness of
      their pace, without a thought in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other carriages were always waiting at the station. Two or three times she
      heard some one near her whisper, &ldquo;That is Madame Fromont Jeune,&rdquo; and,
      indeed, it was a simple matter for people to make the mistake, seeing the
      three return together from the station, Sidonie sitting beside Georges on
      the back seat, laughing and talking with him, and Risler facing them,
      smiling contentedly with his broad hands spread flat upon his knees, but
      evidently feeling a little out of place in that fine carriage. The thought
      that she was taken for Madame Fromont made her very proud, and she became
      a little more accustomed to it every day. On their arrival at the chateau,
      the two families separated until dinner; but, in the presence of his wife
      sitting tranquilly beside the sleeping child, Georges Fromont, too young
      to be absorbed by the joys of domesticity, was continually thinking of the
      brilliant Sidonie, whose voice he could hear pouring forth triumphant
      roulades under the trees in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the whole chateau was thus transformed in obedience to the whims of
      a young woman, old Gardinois continued to lead the narrow life of a
      discontented, idle, impotent &lsquo;parvenu&rsquo;. The most successful means of
      distraction he had discovered was espionage. The goings and comings of his
      servants, the remarks that were made about him in the kitchen, the basket
      of fruit and vegetables brought every morning from the kitchen-garden to
      the pantry, were objects of continual investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the purposes of this constant spying upon his household, he made use
      of a stone bench set in the gravel behind an enormous Paulownia. He would
      sit there whole days at a time, neither reading nor thinking, simply
      watching to see who went in or out. For the night he had invented
      something different. In the great vestibule at the main entrance, which
      opened upon the front steps with their array of bright flowers, he had
      caused an opening to be made leading to his bedroom on the floor above. An
      acoustic tube of an improved type was supposed to convey to his ears every
      sound on the ground floor, even to the conversation of the servants taking
      the air on the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unluckily, the instrument was so powerful that it exaggerated all the
      noises, confused them and prolonged them, and the powerful, regular
      ticking of a great clock, the cries of a paroquet kept in one of the lower
      rooms, the clucking of a hen in search of a lost kernel of corn, were all
      Monsieur Gardinois could hear when he applied his ear to the tube. As for
      voices, they reached him in the form of a confused buzzing, like the
      muttering of a crowd, in which it was impossible to distinguish anything.
      He had nothing to show for the expense of the apparatus, and he concealed
      his wonderful tube in a fold of his bed-curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night Gardinois, who had fallen asleep, was awakened suddenly by the
      creaking of a door. It was an extraordinary thing at that hour. The whole
      house hold was asleep. Nothing could be heard save the footsteps of the
      watch-dogs on the sand, or their scratching at the foot of a tree in which
      an owl was screeching. An excellent opportunity to use his listening-tube!
      Upon putting it to his ear, M. Gardinois was assured that he had made no
      mistake. The sounds continued. One door was opened, then another. The bolt
      of the front door was thrown back with an effort. But neither Pyramus nor
      Thisbe, not even Kiss, the formidable Newfoundland, had made a sign. He
      rose softly to see who those strange burglars could be, who were leaving
      the house instead of entering it; and this is what he saw through the
      slats of his blind:
    </p>
    <p>
      A tall, slender young man, with Georges&rsquo;s figure and carriage, arm-in-arm
      with a woman in a lace mantilla. They stopped first at the bench by the
      Paulownia, which was in full bloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a superb moonlight night. The moon, silvering the treetops, made
      numberless flakes of light amid the dense foliage. The terraces, white
      with moonbeams, where the Newfoundlands in their curly coats went to and
      fro, watching the night butterflies, the smooth, deep waters of the ponds,
      all shone with a mute, calm brilliance, as if reflected in a silver
      mirror. Here and there glow-worms twinkled on the edges of the greensward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two promenaders remained for a moment beneath the shade of the
      Paulownia, sitting silent on the bench, lost in the dense darkness which
      the moon makes where its rays do not reach. Suddenly they appeared in the
      bright light, wrapped in a languishing embrace; then walked slowly across
      the main avenue, and disappeared among the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sure of it!&rdquo; said old Gardinois, recognizing them. Indeed, what
      need had he to recognize them? Did not the silence of the dogs, the aspect
      of the sleeping house, tell him more clearly than anything else could,
      what species of impudent crime, unknown and unpunished, haunted the
      avenues in his park by night? Be that as it may, the old peasant was
      overjoyed by his discovery. He returned to bed without a light, chuckling
      to himself, and in the little cabinet filled with hunting-implements,
      whence he had watched them, thinking at first that he had to do with
      burglars, the moon&rsquo;s rays shone upon naught save the fowling-pieces
      hanging on the wall and the boxes of cartridges of all sizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidonie and Georges had taken up the thread of their love at the corner of
      the same avenue. The year that had passed, marked by hesitation, by vague
      struggles, by fruitless resistance, seemed to have been only a preparation
      for their meeting. And it must be said that, when once the fatal step was
      taken, they were surprised at nothing so much as the fact that they had
      postponed it so long. Georges Fromont especially was seized by a mad
      passion. He was false to his wife, his best friend; he was false to
      Risler, his partner, the faithful companion of his every hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt a constant renewal, a sort of overflow of remorse, wherein his
      passion was intensified by the magnitude of his sin. Sidonie became his
      one engrossing thought, and he discovered that until then he had not
      lived. As for her, her love was made up of vanity and spite. The thing
      that she relished above all else was Claire&rsquo;s degradation in her eyes. Ah!
      if she could only have said to her, &ldquo;Your husband loves me&mdash;he is
      false to you with me,&rdquo; her pleasure would have been even greater. As for
      Risler, in her view he richly deserved what had happened to him. In her
      old apprentice&rsquo;s jargon, in which she still thought, even if she did not
      speak it, the poor man was only &ldquo;an old fool,&rdquo; whom she had taken as a
      stepping-stone to fortune. &ldquo;An old fool&rdquo; is made to be deceived!
    </p>
    <p>
      During the day Savigny belonged to Claire, to the child who ran about upon
      the gravel, laughing at the birds and the clouds, and who grew apace. The
      mother and child had for their own the daylight, the paths filled with
      sunbeams. But the blue nights were given over to sin, to that sin firmly
      installed in the chateau, which spoke in undertones, crept noiselessly
      behind the closed blinds, and in face of which the sleeping house became
      dumb and blind, and resumed its stony impassibility, as if it were ashamed
      to see and hear.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. SIGISMOND PLANUS TREMBLES FOR HIS CASH-BOX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carriage, my dear Chorche?&mdash;I&mdash;have a carriage? What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you, my dear Risler, that it is quite essential for you. Our
      business, our relations, are extending every day; the coupe is no longer
      enough for us. Besides, it doesn&rsquo;t look well to see one of the partners
      always in his carriage and the other on foot. Believe me, it is a
      necessary outlay, and of course it will go into the general expenses of
      the firm. Come, resign yourself to the inevitable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was genuine resignation. It seemed to Risler as if he were stealing
      something in taking the money for such an unheard-of luxury as a carriage;
      however, he ended by yielding to Georges&rsquo;s persistent representations,
      thinking as he did so:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will make Sidonie very happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor fellow had no suspicion that Sidonie herself, a month before, had
      selected at Binder&rsquo;s the coupe which Georges insisted upon giving her, and
      which was to be charged to expense account in order not to alarm the
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honest Risler was so plainly created to be deceived. His inborn
      uprightness, the implicit confidence in men and things, which was the
      foundation of his transparent nature, had been intensified of late by
      preoccupation resulting from his pursuit of the Risler Press, an invention
      destined to revolutionize the wall-paper industry and representing in his
      eyes his contribution to the partnership assets. When he laid aside his
      drawings and left his little work-room on the first floor, his face
      invariably wore the absorbed look of the man who has his life on one side,
      his anxieties on another. What a delight it was to him, therefore, to find
      his home always tranquil, his wife always in good humor, becomingly
      dressed and smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without undertaking to explain the change to himself, he recognized that
      for some time past the &ldquo;little one&rdquo; had not been as before in her
      treatment of him. She allowed him to resume his old habits: the pipe at
      dessert, the little nap after dinner, the appointments at the brewery with
      Chebe and Delobelle. Their apartments also were transformed, embellished.
    </p>
    <p>
      A grand piano by a famous maker made its appearance in the salon in place
      of the old one, and Madame Dobson, the singing-teacher, came no longer
      twice a week, but every day, music-roll in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a curious type was that young woman of American extraction, with hair
      of an acid blond, like lemon-pulp, over a bold forehead and metallic blue
      eyes. As her husband would not allow her to go on the stage, she gave
      lessons, and sang in some bourgeois salons. As a result of living in the
      artificial world of compositions for voice and piano, she had contracted a
      species of sentimental frenzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was romance itself. In her mouth the words &ldquo;love&rdquo; and &ldquo;passion&rdquo; seemed
      to have eighty syllables, she uttered them with so much expression. Oh,
      expression! That was what Mistress Dobson placed before everything, and
      what she tried, and tried in vain, to impart to her pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay Chiquita,&rsquo; upon which Paris fed for several seasons, was then at the
      height of its popularity. Sidonie studied it conscientiously, and all the
      morning she could be heard singing:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;On dit que tu te maries,
          Tu sais que j&rsquo;en puis mourir.&rdquo;
 
          [They say that thou&rsquo;rt to marry
          Thou know&rsquo;st that I may die.]
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mouri-i-i-i-i-r!&rdquo; the expressive Madame Dobson would interpose, while her
      hands wandered feebly over the piano-keys; and die she would, raising her
      light blue eyes to the ceiling and wildly throwing back her head. Sidonie
      never could accomplish it. Her mischievous eyes, her lips, crimson with
      fulness of life, were not made for such AEolian-harp sentimentalities. The
      refrains of Offenbach or Herve, interspersed with unexpected notes, in
      which one resorts to expressive gestures for aid, to a motion of the head
      or the body, would have suited her better; but she dared not admit it to
      her sentimental instructress. By the way, although she had been made to
      sing a great deal at Mademoiselle Le Mire&rsquo;s, her voice was still fresh and
      not unpleasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having no social connections, she came gradually to make a friend of her
      singing-mistress. She would keep her to breakfast, take her to drive in
      the new coupe and to assist in her purchases of gowns and jewels. Madame
      Dobson&rsquo;s sentimental and sympathetic tone led one to repose confidence in
      her. Her continual repinings seemed too long to attract other repinings.
      Sidonie told her of Georges, of their relations, attempting to palliate
      her offence by blaming the cruelty of her parents in marrying her by force
      to a man much older than herself. Madame Dobson at once showed a
      disposition to assist them; not that the little woman was venal, but she
      had a passion for passion, a taste for romantic intrigue. As she was
      unhappy in her own home, married to a dentist who beat her, all husbands
      were monsters in her eyes, and poor Risler especially seemed to her a
      horrible tyrant whom his wife was quite justified in hating and deceiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was an active confidant and a very useful one. Two or three times a
      week she would bring tickets for a box at the Opera or the Italiens, or
      some one of the little theatres which enjoy a temporary vogue, and cause
      all Paris to go from one end of Paris to the other for a season. In
      Risler&rsquo;s eyes the tickets came from Madame Dobson; she had as many as she
      chose to the theatres where operas were given. The poor wretch had no
      suspicion that one of those boxes for an important &ldquo;first night&rdquo; had often
      cost his partner ten or fifteen Louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, when his wife went away, always splendidly attired, he
      would gaze admiringly at her, having no suspicion of the cost of her
      costumes, certainly none of the man who paid for them, and would await her
      return at his table by the fire, busy with his drawings, free from care,
      and happy to be able to say to himself, &ldquo;What a good time she is having!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the floor below, at the Fromonts&rsquo;, the same comedy was being played,
      but with a transposition of parts. There it was the young wife who sat by
      the fire. Every evening, half an hour after Sidonie&rsquo;s departure, the great
      gate swung open to give passage to the Fromont coupe conveying Monsieur to
      his club. What would you have? Business has its demands. All the great
      deals are arranged at the club, around the bouillotte table, and a man
      must go there or suffer the penalty of seeing his business fall off.
      Claire innocently believed it all. When her husband had gone, she felt sad
      for a moment. She would have liked so much to keep him with her or to go
      out leaning on his arm, to seek enjoyment with him. But the sight of the
      child, cooing in front of the fire and kicking her little pink feet while
      she was being undressed, speedily soothed the mother. Then the eloquent
      word &ldquo;business,&rdquo; the merchant&rsquo;s reason of state, was always at hand to
      help her to resign herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georges and Sidonie met at the theatre. Their feeling at first when they
      were together was one of satisfied vanity. People stared at them a great
      deal. She was really pretty now, and her irregular but attractive
      features, which required the aid of all the eccentricities of the
      prevailing style in order to produce their full effect, adapted themselves
      to them so perfectly that you would have said they were invented expressly
      for her. In a few moments they went away, and Madame Dobson was left alone
      in the box. They had hired a small suite on the Avenue Gabriel, near the
      &lsquo;rond-point&rsquo; of the Champs Elysees&mdash;the dream of the young women at
      the Le Mire establishment&mdash;two luxuriously furnished, quiet rooms,
      where the silence of the wealthy quarter, disturbed only by passing
      carriages, formed a blissful surrounding for their love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little, when she had become accustomed to her sin, she conceived
      the most audacious whims. From her old working-days she had retained in
      the depths of her memory the names of public balls, of famous restaurants,
      where she was eager to go now, just as she took pleasure in causing the
      doors to be thrown open for her at the establishments of the great
      dressmakers, whose signs only she had known in her earlier days. For what
      she sought above all else in this liaison was revenge for the sorrows and
      humiliations of her youth. Nothing delighted her so much, for example,
      when returning from an evening drive in the Bois, as a supper at the Cafe
      Anglais with the sounds of luxurious vice around her. From these repeated
      excursions she brought back peculiarities of speech and behavior,
      equivocal songs, and a style of dress that imported into the bourgeois
      atmosphere of the old commercial house an accurate reproduction of the
      most advanced type of the Paris cocotte of that period.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the factory they began to suspect something. The women of the people,
      even the poorest, are so quick at picking a costume to pieces! When Madame
      Risler went out, about three o&rsquo;clock, fifty pairs of sharp, envious eyes,
      lying in ambush at the windows of the polishing-shop, watched her pass,
      penetrating to the lowest depths of her guilty conscience through her
      black velvet dolman and her cuirass of sparkling jet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although she did not suspect it, all the secrets of that mad brain were
      flying about her like the ribbons that played upon her bare neck; and her
      daintily-shod feet, in their bronzed boots with ten buttons, told the
      story of all sorts of clandestine expeditions, of the carpeted stairways
      they ascended at night on their way to supper, and the warm fur robes in
      which they were wrapped when the coupe made the circuit of the lake in the
      darkness dotted with lanterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work-women laughed sneeringly and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just look at that Tata Bebelle! A fine way to dress to go out. She don&rsquo;t
      rig herself up like that to go to mass, that&rsquo;s sure! To think that it
      ain&rsquo;t three years since she used to start for the shop every morning in an
      old waterproof, and two sous&rsquo; worth of roasted chestnuts in her pockets to
      keep her fingers warm. Now she rides in her carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And amid the talc dust and the roaring of the stoves, red-hot in winter
      and summer alike, more than one poor girl reflected on the caprice of
      chance in absolutely transforming a woman&rsquo;s existence, and began to dream
      vaguely of a magnificent future which might perhaps be in store for
      herself without her suspecting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In everybody&rsquo;s opinion Risler was a dishonored husband. Two assistants in
      the printing-room&mdash;faithful patrons of the Folies Dramatiques&mdash;declared
      that they had seen Madame Risler several times at their theatre,
      accompanied by some escort who kept out of sight at the rear of the box.
      Pere Achille, too, told of amazing things. That Sidonie had a lover, that
      she had several lovers, in fact, no one entertained a doubt. But no one
      had as yet thought of Fromont jeune.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet she showed no prudence whatever in her relations with him. On the
      contrary, she seemed to make a parade of them; it may be that that was
      what saved them. How many times she accosted him boldly on the steps to
      agree upon a rendezvous for the evening! How many times she had amused
      herself in making him shudder by looking into his eyes before every one!
      When the first confusion had passed, Georges was grateful to her for these
      exhibitions of audacity, which he attributed to the intensity of her
      passion. He was mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      What she would have liked, although she did not admit it to herself, would
      have been to have Claire see them, to have her draw aside the curtain at
      her window, to have her conceive a suspicion of what was passing. She
      needed that in order to be perfectly happy: that her rival should be
      unhappy. But her wish was ungratified; Claire Fromont noticed nothing and
      lived, as did Risler, in imperturbable serenity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Sigismond, the old cashier, was really ill at ease. And yet he was
      not thinking of Sidonie when, with his pen behind his ear, he paused a
      moment in his work and gazed fixedly through his grating at the drenched
      soil of the little garden. He was thinking solely of his master, of
      Monsieur &ldquo;Chorche,&rdquo; who was drawing a great deal of money now for his
      current expenses and sowing confusion in all his books. Every time it was
      some new excuse. He would come to the little wicket with an unconcerned
      air:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a little money, my good Planus? I was worsted again at
      bouillotte last night, and I don&rsquo;t want to send to the bank for such a
      trifle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sigismond Planus would open his cash-box, with an air of regret, to get
      the sum requested, and he would remember with terror a certain day when
      Monsieur Georges, then only twenty years old, had confessed to his uncle
      that he owed several thousand francs in gambling debts. The elder man
      thereupon conceived a violent antipathy for the club and contempt for all
      its members. A rich tradesman who was a member happened to come to the
      factory one day, and Sigismond said to him with brutal frankness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil take your &lsquo;Cercle du Chateau d&rsquo;Eau!&rsquo; Monsieur Georges has left
      more than thirty thousand francs there in two months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re greatly mistaken, Pere Planus&mdash;it&rsquo;s at least three
      months since we have seen your master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cashier did not pursue the conversation; but a terrible thought took
      up its abode in his mind, and he turned it over and over all day long.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Georges did not go to the club, where did he pass his evenings? Where
      did he spend so much money?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was evidently a woman at the bottom of the affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as that idea occurred to him, Sigismond Planus began to tremble
      seriously for his cash-box. That old bear from the canton of Berne, a
      confirmed bachelor, had a terrible dread of women in general and Parisian
      women in particular. He deemed it his duty, first of all, in order to set
      his conscience at rest, to warn Risler. He did it at first in rather a
      vague way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Georges is spending a great deal of money,&rdquo; he said to him one
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler exhibited no surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you expect me to do, my old Sigismond? It is his right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the honest fellow meant what he said. In his eyes Fromont jeune was
      the absolute master of the establishment. It would have been a fine thing,
      and no mistake, for him, an ex-draughtsman, to venture to make any
      comments. The cashier dared say no more until the day when a messenger
      came from a great shawl-house with a bill for six thousand francs for a
      cashmere shawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to Georges in his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I pay it, Monsieur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Georges Fromont was a little annoyed. Sidonie had forgotten to tell him of
      this latest purchase; she used no ceremony with him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pay it, pay it, Pere Planus,&rdquo; he said, with a shade of embarrassment, and
      added: &ldquo;Charge it to the account of Fromont jeune. It is a commission
      intrusted to me by a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening, as Sigismond was lighting his little lamp, he saw Risler
      crossing the garden, and tapped on the window to call him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a woman,&rdquo; he said, under his breath. &ldquo;I have the proof of it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he uttered the awful words &ldquo;a woman&rdquo; his voice shook with alarm and was
      drowned in the great uproar of the factory. The sounds of the work in
      progress had a sinister meaning to the unhappy cashier at that moment. It
      seemed to him as if all the whirring machinery, the great chimney pouring
      forth its clouds of smoke, the noise of the workmen at their different
      tasks&mdash;as if all this tumult and bustle and fatigue were for the
      benefit of a mysterious little being, dressed in velvet and adorned with
      jewels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler laughed at him and refused to believe him. He had long been
      acquainted with his compatriot&rsquo;s mania for detecting in everything the
      pernicious influence of woman. And yet Planus&rsquo;s words sometimes recurred
      to his thoughts, especially in the evening when Sidonie, after all the
      commotion attendant upon the completion of her toilette, went away to the
      theatre with Madame Dobson, leaving the apartment empty as soon as her
      long train had swept across the threshold. Candles burning in front of the
      mirrors, divers little toilette articles scattered about and thrown aside,
      told of extravagant caprices and a reckless expenditure of money. Risler
      thought nothing of all that; but, when he heard Georges&rsquo;s carriage rolling
      through the courtyard, he had a feeling of discomfort at the thought of
      Madame Fromont passing her evenings entirely alone. Poor woman! Suppose
      what Planus said were true!
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose Georges really had a second establishment! Oh, it would be
      frightful!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, instead of beginning to work, he would go softly downstairs and
      ask if Madame were visible, deeming it his duty to keep her company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little girl was always in bed, but the little cap, the blue shoes,
      were still lying in front of the fire. Claire was either reading or
      working, with her silent mother beside her, always rubbing or dusting with
      feverish energy, exhausting herself by blowing on the case of her watch,
      and nervously taking the same thing up and putting it down again ten times
      in succession, with the obstinate persistence of mania. Nor was honest
      Risler a very entertaining companion; but that did not prevent the young
      woman from welcoming him kindly. She knew all that was said about Sidonie
      in the factory; and although she did not believe half of it, the sight of
      the poor man, whom his wife left alone so often, moved her heart to pity.
      Mutual compassion formed the basis of that placid friendship, and nothing
      could be more touching than these two deserted ones, one pitying the other
      and each trying to divert the other&rsquo;s thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated at the small, brightly lighted table in the centre of the salon,
      Risler would gradually yield to the influence of the warmth of the fire
      and the harmony of his surroundings. He found there articles of furniture
      with which he had been familiar for twenty years, the portrait of his
      former employer; and his dear Madame Chorche, bending over some little
      piece of needle work at his side, seemed to him even younger and more
      lovable among all those old souvenirs. From time to time she would rise to
      go and look at the child sleeping in the adjoining room, whose soft
      breathing they could hear in the intervals of silence. Without fully
      realizing it, Risler felt more comfortable and warmer there than in his
      own apartment; for on certain days those attractive rooms, where the doors
      were forever being thrown open for hurried exits or returns, gave him the
      impression of a hall without doors or windows, open to the four winds. His
      rooms were a camping-ground; this was a home. A care-taking hand caused
      order and refinement to reign everywhere. The chairs seemed to be talking
      together in undertones, the fire burned with a delightful sound, and
      Mademoiselle Fromont&rsquo;s little cap retained in every bow of its blue
      ribbons suggestions of sweet smiles and baby glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while Claire was thinking that such an excellent man deserved a better
      companion in life, Risler, watching the calm and lovely face turned toward
      him, the intelligent, kindly eyes, asked himself who the hussy could be
      for whom Georges Fromont neglected such an adorable woman.

      CHAPTER XI. THE INVENTORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The house in which old Planus lived at Montrouge adjoined the one which
      the Chebes had occupied for some time. There was the same ground floor
      with three windows, and a single floor above, the same garden with its
      latticework fence, the same borders of green box. There the old cashier
      lived with his sister. He took the first omnibus that left the office in
      the morning, returned at dinner-time, and on Sundays remained at home,
      tending his flowers and his poultry. The old maid was his housekeeper and
      did all the cooking and sewing. A happier couple never lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Celibates both, they were bound together by an equal hatred of marriage.
      The sister abhorred all men, the brother looked upon all women with
      suspicion; but they adored each other, each considering the other an
      exception to the general perversity of the sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      In speaking of him she always said: &ldquo;Monsieur Planus, my brother!&rdquo;&mdash;and
      he, with the same affectionate solemnity, interspersed all his sentences
      with &ldquo;Mademoiselle Planus, my sister!&rdquo; To those two retiring and innocent
      creatures, Paris, of which they knew nothing, although they visited it
      every day, was a den of monsters of two varieties, bent upon doing one
      another the utmost possible injury; and whenever, amid the gossip of the
      quarter, a conjugal drama came to their ears, each of them, beset by his
      or her own idea, blamed a different culprit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the husband&rsquo;s fault,&rdquo; would be the verdict of &ldquo;Mademoiselle Planus,
      my sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the wife&rsquo;s fault,&rdquo; &ldquo;Monsieur Planus, my brother,&rdquo; would reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the men&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the women&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was their one never-failing subject of discussion in those rare hours
      of idleness which old Sigismond set aside in his busy day, which was as
      carefully ruled off as his account-books. For some time past the
      discussions between the brother and sister had been marked by
      extraordinary animation. They were deeply interested in what was taking
      place at the factory. The sister was full of pity for Madame Fromont and
      considered her husband&rsquo;s conduct altogether outrageous; as for Sigismond,
      he could find no words bitter enough for the unknown trollop who sent
      bills for six-thousand-franc shawls to be paid from his cashbox. In his
      eyes, the honor and fair fame of the old house he had served since his
      youth were at stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will become of us?&rdquo; he repeated again and again. &ldquo;Oh! these women&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One day Mademoiselle Planus sat by the fire with her knitting, waiting for
      her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table had been laid for half an hour, and the old lady was beginning
      to be worried by such unheard-of tardiness, when Sigismond entered with a
      most distressed face, and without a word, which was contrary to all his
      habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited until the door was shut tight, then said in a low voice, in
      response to his sister&rsquo;s disturbed and questioning expression:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have some news. I know who the woman is who is doing her best to ruin
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lowering his voice still more, after glancing about at the silent walls of
      their little dining-room, he uttered a name so unexpected that
      Mademoiselle Planus made him repeat it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, despite his grief, he had almost a triumphant air.
    </p>
    <p>
      His old sister could not believe it. Such a refined, polite person, who
      had received her with so much cordiality!&mdash;How could any one imagine
      such a thing?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have proofs,&rdquo; said Sigismond Planus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon he told her how Pere Achille had met Sidonie and Georges one
      night at eleven o&rsquo;clock, just as they entered a small furnished
      lodging-house in the Montmartre quarter; and he was a man who never lied.
      They had known him for a long while. Besides, others had met them. Nothing
      else was talked about at the factory. Risler alone suspected nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is your duty to tell him,&rdquo; declared Mademoiselle Planus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cashier&rsquo;s face assumed a grave expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a very delicate matter. In the first place, who knows whether he
      would believe me? There are blind men so blind that&mdash;And then, by
      interfering between the two partners, I risk the loss of my place. Oh! the
      women&mdash;the women! When I think how happy Risler might have been. When
      I sent for him to come to Paris with his brother, he hadn&rsquo;t a sou; and
      to-day he is at the head of one of the first houses in Paris. Do you
      suppose that he would be content with that? Oh! no, of course not!
      Monsieur must marry. As if any one needed to marry! And, worse yet, he
      marries a Parisian woman, one of those frowsy-haired chits that are the
      ruin of an honest house, when he had at his hand a fine girl, of almost
      his own age, a countrywoman, used to work, and well put together, as you
      might say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Planus, my sister,&rdquo; to whose physical structure he alluded,
      had a magnificent opportunity to exclaim, &ldquo;Oh! the men, the men!&rdquo; but she
      was silent. It was a very delicate question, and perhaps, if Risler had
      chosen in time, he might have been the only one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Sigismond continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is what we have come to. For three months the leading wall-paper
      factory in Paris has been tied to the petticoats of that good-for-nothing.
      You should see how the money flies. All day long I do nothing but open my
      wicket to meet Monsieur Georges&rsquo;s calls. He always applies to me, because
      at his banker&rsquo;s too much notice would be taken of it, whereas in our
      office money comes and goes, comes in and goes out. But look out for the
      inventory! We shall have some pretty figures to show at the end of the
      year. The worst part of the whole business is that Risler won&rsquo;t listen to
      anything. I have warned him several times: &lsquo;Look out, Monsieur Georges is
      making a fool of himself for some woman.&rsquo; He either turns away with a
      shrug, or else he tells me that it is none of his business and that
      Fromont Jeune is the master. Upon my word, one would almost think&mdash;one
      would almost think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cashier did not finish his sentence; but his silence was pregnant with
      unspoken thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old maid was appalled; but, like most women under such circumstances,
      instead of seeking a remedy for the evil, she wandered off into a maze of
      regrets, conjectures, and retrospective lamentations. What a misfortune
      that they had not known it sooner when they had the Chebes for neighbors.
      Madame Chebe was such an honorable woman. They might have put the matter
      before her so that she would keep an eye on Sidonie and talk seriously to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, that&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; Sigismond interrupted. &ldquo;You must go to the
      Rue du Mail and tell her parents. I thought at first of writing to little
      Frantz. He always had a great deal of influence over his brother, and he&rsquo;s
      the only person on earth who could say certain things to him. But Frantz
      is so far away. And then it would be such a terrible thing to do. I can&rsquo;t
      help pitying that unlucky Risler, though. No! the best way is to tell
      Madame Chebe. Will you undertake to do it, sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a dangerous commission. Mademoiselle Planus made some objections,
      but she never had been able to resist her brother&rsquo;s wishes, and the desire
      to be of service to their old friend Risler assisted materially in
      persuading her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to his son-in-law&rsquo;s kindness, M. Chebe had succeeded in gratifying
      his latest whim. For three months past he had been living at his famous
      warehouse on the Rue du Mail, and a great sensation was created in the
      quarter by that shop without merchandise, the shutters of which were taken
      down in the morning and put up again at night, as in wholesale houses.
      Shelves had been placed all around the walls, there was a new counter, a
      safe, a huge pair of scales. In a word, M. Chebe possessed all the
      requisites of a business of some sort, but did not know as yet just what
      business he would choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pondered the subject all day as he walked to and fro across the shop,
      encumbered with several large pieces of bedroom furniture which they had
      been unable to get into the back room; he pondered it, too, as he stood on
      his doorstep, with his pen behind his ear, and feasted his eyes
      delightedly on the hurly-burly of Parisian commerce. The clerks who passed
      with their packages of samples under their arms, the vans of the express
      companies, the omnibuses, the porters, the wheelbarrows, the great bales
      of merchandise at the neighboring doors, the packages of rich stuffs and
      trimmings which were dragged in the mud before being consigned to those
      underground regions, those dark holes stuffed with treasures, where the
      fortune of business lies in embryo&mdash;all these things delighted M.
      Chebe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He amused himself guessing at the contents of the bales and was first at
      the fray when some passer-by received a heavy package upon his feet, or
      the horses attached to a dray, spirited and restive, made the long vehicle
      standing across the street an obstacle to circulation. He had, moreover,
      the thousand-and-one distractions of the petty tradesman without
      customers, the heavy showers, the accidents, the thefts, the disputes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the day M. Chebe, dazed, bewildered, worn out by the labor
      of other people, would stretch himself out in his easy-chair and say to
      his wife, as he wiped his forehead:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of life I need&mdash;an active life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Chebe would smile softly without replying. Accustomed as she was to
      all her husband&rsquo;s whims, she had made herself as comfortable as possible
      in a back room with an outlook upon a dark yard, consoling herself with
      reflections on the former prosperity of her parents and her daughter&rsquo;s
      wealth; and, being always neatly dressed, she had succeeded already in
      acquiring the respect of neighbors and tradesmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked nothing more than not to be confounded with the wives of
      workingmen, often less poor than herself, and to be allowed to retain, in
      spite of everything, a petty bourgeois superiority. That was her constant
      thought; and so the back room in which she lived, and where it was dark at
      three in the afternoon, was resplendent with order and cleanliness. During
      the day the bed became a couch, an old shawl did duty as a tablecloth, the
      fireplace, hidden by a screen, served as a pantry, and the meals were
      cooked in modest retirement on a stove no larger than a foot-warmer. A
      tranquil life&mdash;that was the dream of the poor woman, who was
      continually tormented by the whims of an uncongenial companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early days of his tenancy, M. Chebe had caused these words to be
      inscribed in letters a foot long on the fresh paint of his shop-front:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          COMMISSION&mdash;EXPORTATION
</pre>
    <p>
      No specifications. His neighbors sold tulle, broadcloth, linen; he was
      inclined to sell everything, but could not make up his mind just what.
      With what arguments did his indecision lead him to favor Madame Chebe as
      they sat together in the evening!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about linen; but when you come to broadcloth, I
      understand that. Only, if I go into broadcloths I must have a man to
      travel; for the best kinds come from Sedan and Elbeuf. I say nothing about
      calicoes; summer is the time for them. As for tulle, that&rsquo;s out of the
      question; the season is too far advanced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He usually brought his discourse to a close with the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The night will bring counsel&mdash;let us go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And to bed he would go, to his wife&rsquo;s great relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      After three or four months of this life, M. Chebe began to tire of it. The
      pains in the head, the dizzy fits gradually returned. The quarter was
      noisy and unhealthy: besides, business was at a standstill. Nothing was to
      be done in any line, broadcloths, tissues, or anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just at the period of this new crisis that &ldquo;Mademoiselle Planus, my
      sister,&rdquo; called to speak about Sidonie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old maid had said to herself on the way, &ldquo;I must break it gently.&rdquo;
       But, like all shy people, she relieved herself of her burden in the first
      words she spoke after entering the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a stunning blow. When she heard the accusation made against her
      daughter, Madame Chebe rose in indignation. No one could ever make her
      believe such a thing. Her poor Sidonie was the victim of an infamous
      slander.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Chebe, for his part, adopted a very lofty tone, with significant
      phrases and motions of the head, taking everything to himself as was his
      custom. How could any one suppose that his child, a Chebe, the daughter of
      an honorable business man known for thirty years on the street, was
      capable of Nonsense!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Planus insisted. It was a painful thing to her to be
      considered a gossip, a hawker of unsavory stories. But they had
      incontestable proofs. It was no longer a secret to anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And even suppose it were true,&rdquo; cried M. Chebe, furious at her
      persistence. &ldquo;Is it for us to worry about it? Our daughter is married. She
      lives a long way from her parents. It is for her husband, who is much
      older than she, to advise and guide her. Does he so much as think of doing
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon that the little man began to inveigh against his son-in-law, that
      cold-blooded Swiss, who passed his life in his office devising machines,
      refused to accompany his wife into society, and preferred his old-bachelor
      habits, his pipe and his brewery, to everything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should have seen the air of aristocratic disdain with which M. Chebe
      pronounced the word &ldquo;brewery!&rdquo; And yet almost every evening he went there
      to meet Risler, and overwhelmed him with reproaches if he once failed to
      appear at the rendezvous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind all this verbiage the merchant of the Rue du Mail&mdash;&ldquo;Commission-Exportation&rdquo;&mdash;had
      a very definite idea. He wished to give up his shop, to retire from
      business, and for some time he had been thinking of going to see Sidonie,
      in order to interest her in his new schemes. That was not the time,
      therefore, to make disagreeable scenes, to prate about paternal authority
      and conjugal honor. As for Madame Chebe, being somewhat less confident
      than before of her daughter&rsquo;s virtue, she took refuge in the most profound
      silence. The poor woman wished that she were deaf and blind&mdash;that she
      never had known Mademoiselle Planus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all persons who have been very unhappy, she loved a benumbed
      existence with a semblance of tranquillity, and ignorance seemed to her
      preferable to everything. As if life were not sad enough, good heavens!
      And then, after all, Sidonie had always been a good girl; why should she
      not be a good woman?
    </p>
    <p>
      Night was falling. M. Chebe rose gravely to close the shutters of the shop
      and light a gas-jet which illumined the bare walls, the empty, polished
      shelves, and the whole extraordinary place, which reminded one strongly of
      the day following a failure. With his lips closed disdainfully, in his
      determination to remain silent, he seemed to say to the old lady, &ldquo;Night
      has come&mdash;it is time for you to go home.&rdquo; And all the while they
      could hear Madame Chebe sobbing in the back room, as she went to and fro
      preparing supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Planus got no further satisfaction from her visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; queried old Sigismond, who was impatiently awaiting her return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t believe me, and politely showed me the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had tears in her eyes at the thought of her humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s face flushed, and he said in a grave voice, taking his
      sister&rsquo;s hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Planus, my sister, I ask your pardon for having made you
      take this step; but the honor of the house of Fromont was at stake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From that moment Sigismond became more and more depressed. His cash-box no
      longer seemed to him safe or secure. Even when Fromont Jeune did not ask
      him for money, he was afraid, and he summed up all his apprehensions in
      four words which came continually to his lips when talking with his
      sister:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ha no gonfidence,&rdquo; he would say, in his hoarse Swiss patois.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking always of his cash-box, he dreamed sometimes that it had broken
      apart at all the joints, and insisted on remaining open, no matter how
      much he turned the key; or else that a high wind had scattered all the
      papers, notes, cheques, and bills, and that he ran after them all over the
      factory, tiring himself out in the attempt to pick them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the daytime, as he sat behind his grating in the silence of his office,
      he imagined that a little white mouse had eaten its way through the bottom
      of the box and was gnawing and destroying all its contents, growing
      plumper and prettier as the work of destruction went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that, when Sidonie appeared on the steps about the middle of the
      afternoon, in her pretty Parisian plumage, old Sigismond shuddered with
      rage. In his eyes it was the ruin of the house that stood there, ruin in a
      magnificent costume, with its little coupe at the door, and the placid
      bearing of a happy coquette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Risler had no suspicion that, at that window on the ground floor,
      sat an untiring foe who watched her slightest movements, the most trivial
      details of her life, the going and coming of her music-teacher, the
      arrival of the fashionable dressmaker in the morning, all the boxes that
      were brought to the house, and the laced cap of the employe of the Magasin
      du Louvre, whose heavy wagon stopped at the gate with a jingling of bells,
      like a diligence drawn by stout horses which were dragging the house of
      Fromont to bankruptcy at break-neck speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sigismond counted the packages, weighed them with his eye as they passed,
      and gazed inquisitively into Risler&rsquo;s apartments through the open windows.
      The carpets that were shaken with a great noise, the jardinieres that were
      brought into the sunlight filled with fragile, unseasonable flowers, rare
      and expensive, the gorgeous hangings&mdash;none of these things escaped
      his notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new acquisitions of the household stared him in the face, reminding
      him of some request for a large amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the one thing that he studied more carefully than all else was
      Risler&rsquo;s countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his view that woman was in a fair way to change his friend, the best,
      the most upright of men, into a shameless villain. There was no
      possibility of doubt that Risler knew of his dishonor, and submitted to
      it. He was paid to keep quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly there was something monstrous in such a supposition. But it is
      the tendency of innocent natures, when they are made acquainted with evil
      for the first time, to go at once too far, beyond reason. When he was once
      convinced of the treachery of Georges and Sidonie, Risler&rsquo;s degradation
      seemed to the cashier less impossible of comprehension. On what other
      theory could his indifference, in the face of his partner&rsquo;s heavy
      expenditures, be explained?
    </p>
    <p>
      The excellent Sigismond, in his narrow, stereotyped honesty, could not
      understand the delicacy of Risler&rsquo;s heart. At the same time, the
      methodical bookkeeper&rsquo;s habit of thought and his clear-sightedness in
      business were a thousand leagues from that absent-minded, flighty
      character, half-artist, half-inventor. He judged him by himself, having no
      conception of the condition of a man with the disease of invention,
      absorbed by a fixed idea. Such men are somnambulists. They look, but do
      not see, their eyes being turned within.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Sigismond&rsquo;s belief that Risler did see. That belief made the old
      cashier very unhappy. He began by staring at his friend whenever he
      entered the counting-room; then, discouraged by his immovable
      indifference, which he believed to be wilful and premeditated, covering
      his face like a mask, he adopted the plan of turning away and fumbling
      among his papers to avoid those false glances, and keeping his eyes fixed
      on the garden paths or the interlaced wires of the grating when he spoke
      to him. Even his words were confused and distorted, like his glances. No
      one could say positively to whom he was talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      No more friendly smiles, no more reminiscences as they turned over the
      leaves of the cash-book together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was the year you came to the factory. Your first increase of pay. Do
      you remember? We dined at Douix&rsquo;s that day. And then the Cafe des Aveugles
      in the evening, eh? What a debauch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last Risler noticed the strange coolness that had sprung up between
      Sigismond and himself. He mentioned it to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time past she had felt that antipathy prowling about her.
      Sometimes, as she crossed the courtyard, she was oppressed, as it were, by
      malevolent glances which caused her to turn nervously toward the old
      cashier&rsquo;s corner. This estrangement between the friends alarmed her, and
      she very quickly determined to put her husband on his guard against
      Planus&rsquo;s unpleasant remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that he is jealous of you, of your position? A man who was
      once his equal, now his superior, he can&rsquo;t stand that. But why bother
      one&rsquo;s head about all these spiteful creatures? Why, I am surrounded by
      them here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Risler looked at her with wide-open eyes:&mdash;&ldquo;You?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, it is easy enough to see that all these people detest me. They
      bear little Chebe a grudge because she has become Madame Risler Aine.
      Heaven only knows all the outrageous things that are said about me! And
      your cashier doesn&rsquo;t keep his tongue in his pocket, I assure you. What a
      spiteful fellow he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These few words had their effect. Risler, indignant, but too proud to
      complain, met coldness with coldness. Those two honest men, each intensely
      distrustful of the other, could no longer meet without a painful
      sensation, so that, after a while, Risler ceased to go to the
      counting-room at all. It was not difficult for him, as Fromont Jeune had
      charge of all financial matters. His month&rsquo;s allowance was carried to him
      on the thirtieth of each month. This arrangement afforded Sidonie and
      Georges additional facilities, and opportunity for all sorts of underhand
      dealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thereupon turned her attention to the completion of her programme of a
      life of luxury. She lacked a country house. In her heart she detested the
      trees, the fields, the country roads that cover you with dust. &ldquo;The most
      dismal things on earth,&rdquo; she used to say. But Claire Fromont passed the
      summer at Savigny. As soon as the first fine days arrived, the trunks were
      packed and the curtains taken down on the floor below; and a great
      furniture van, with the little girl&rsquo;s blue bassinet rocking on top, set
      off for the grandfather&rsquo;s chateau. Then, one morning, the mother,
      grandmother, child, and nurse, a medley of white gowns and light veils,
      would drive away behind two fast horses toward the sunny lawns and the
      pleasant shade of the avenues.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that season Paris was ugly, depopulated; and although Sidonie loved it
      even in the summer, which heats it like a furnace, it troubled her to
      think that all the fashion and wealth of Paris were driving by the
      seashore under their light umbrellas, and would make their outing an
      excuse for a thousand new inventions, for original styles of the most
      risque sort, which would permit one to show that one has a pretty ankle
      and long, curly chestnut hair of one&rsquo;s own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seashore bathing resorts! She could not think of them; Risler could
      not leave Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      How about buying a country house? They had not the means. To be sure,
      there was the lover, who would have asked nothing better than to gratify
      this latest whim; but a country house cannot be concealed like a bracelet
      or a shawl. The husband must be induced to accept it. That was not an easy
      matter; however, they might venture to try it with Risler.
    </p>
    <p>
      To pave the way, she talked to him incessantly about a little nook in the
      country, not too expensive, very near Paris. Risler listened with a smile.
      He thought of the high grass, of the orchard filled with fine fruit-trees,
      being already tormented by the longing to possess which comes with wealth;
      but, as he was prudent, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will see, we will see. Let us wait till the end of the year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The end of the year, that is to say, the striking of the balance-sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The balance-sheet! That is the magic word. All through the year we go on
      and on in the eddying whirl of business. Money comes and goes, circulates,
      attracts other money, vanishes; and the fortune of the firm, like a
      slippery, gleaming snake, always in motion, expands, contracts,
      diminishes, or increases, and it is impossible to know our condition until
      there comes a moment of rest. Not until the inventory shall we know the
      truth, and whether the year, which seems to have been prosperous, has
      really been so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The account of stock is usually taken late in December, between Christmas
      and New Year&rsquo;s Day. As it requires much extra labor to prepare it,
      everybody works far into the night. The whole establishment is alert. The
      lamps remain lighted in the offices long after the doors are closed, and
      seem to share in the festal atmosphere peculiar to that last week of the
      year, when so many windows are illuminated for family gatherings. Every
      one, even to the least important &lsquo;employe&rsquo; of the firm, is interested in
      the results of the inventory. The increases of salary, the New Year&rsquo;s
      presents, depend upon those blessed figures. And so, while the vast
      interests of a wealthy house are trembling in the balance, the wives and
      children and aged parents of the clerks, in their fifth-floor tenements or
      poor apartments in the suburbs, talk of nothing but the inventory, the
      results of which will make themselves felt either by a greatly increased
      need of economy or by some purchase, long postponed, which the New Year&rsquo;s
      gift will make possible at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the premises of Fromont Jeune and Risler Aine, Sigismond Planus is the
      god of the establishment at that season, and his little office a sanctuary
      where all the clerks perform their devotions. In the silence of the
      sleeping factory, the heavy pages of the great books rustle as they are
      turned, and names called aloud cause search to be made in other books.
      Pens scratch. The old cashier, surrounded by his lieutenants, has a
      businesslike, awe-inspiring air. From time to time Fromont Jeune, on the
      point of going out in his carriage, looks in for a moment, with a cigar in
      his mouth, neatly gloved and ready for the street. He walks slowly, on
      tiptoe, puts his face to the grating:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&mdash;are you getting on all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sigismond gives a grunt, and the young master takes his leave, afraid to
      ask any further questions. He knows from the cashier&rsquo;s expression that the
      showing will be a bad one.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, since the days of the Revolution, when there was fighting in the
      very courtyard of the factory, so pitiable an inventory never had been
      seen in the Fromont establishment. Receipts and expenditures balanced each
      other. The general expense account had eaten up everything, and,
      furthermore, Fromont Jeune was indebted to the firm in a large sum. You
      should have seen old Planus&rsquo;s air of consternation when, on the 31st of
      December, he went up to Georges&rsquo;s office to make report of his labors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georges took a very cheerful view of the matter. Everything would go
      better next year. And to restore the cashier&rsquo;s good humor he gave him an
      extraordinary bonus of a thousand francs, instead of the five hundred his
      uncle used always to give. Everybody felt the effects of that generous
      impulse, and, in the universal satisfaction, the deplorable results of the
      yearly accounting were very soon forgotten. As for Risler, Georges chose
      to take it upon himself to inform him as to the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he entered his partner&rsquo;s little closet, which was lighted from above
      by a window in the ceiling, so that the light fell directly upon the
      subject of the inventor&rsquo;s meditations, Fromont hesitated a moment, filled
      with shame and remorse for what he was about to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other, when he heard the door, turned joyfully toward his partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chorche, Chorche, my dear fellow&mdash;I have got it, our press. There
      are still a few little things to think out. But no matter! I am sure now
      of my invention: you will see&mdash;you will see! Ah! the Prochassons can
      experiment all they choose. With the Risler Press we will crush all
      rivalry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo, my comrade!&rdquo; replied Fromont Jeune. &ldquo;So much for the future; but
      you don&rsquo;t seem to think about the present. What about this inventory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes! to be sure. I had forgotten all about it. It isn&rsquo;t very
      satisfactory, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said that because of the somewhat disturbed and embarrassed expression
      on Georges&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, on the contrary, it is very satisfactory indeed,&rdquo; was the
      reply. &ldquo;We have every reason to be satisfied, especially as this is our
      first year together. We have forty thousand francs each for our share of
      the profits; and as I thought you might need a little money to give your
      wife a New Year&rsquo;s present&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ashamed to meet the eyes of the honest man whose confidence he was
      betraying, Fromont jeune placed a bundle of cheques and notes on the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler was deeply moved for a moment. So much money at one time for him!
      His mind dwelt upon the generosity of these Fromonts, who had made him
      what he was; then he thought of his little Sidonie, of the longing which
      she had so often expressed and which he would now be able to gratify.
    </p>
    <p>
      With tears in his eyes and a happy smile on his lips, he held out both
      hands to his partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very happy! I am very happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was his favorite phrase on great occasions. Then he pointed to the
      bundles of bank notes spread out before him in the narrow bands which are
      used to confine those fugitive documents, always ready to fly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what that is?&rdquo; he said to Georges, with an air of triumph.
      &ldquo;That is Sidonie&rsquo;s house in the country!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XII. A LETTER
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;TO M. FRANTZ RISLER,

   &ldquo;Engineer of the Compagnie Francaise,
   &ldquo;Ismailia, Egypt.

   &ldquo;Frantz, my boy, it is old Sigismond who is writing to you. If I
   knew better how to put my ideas on paper, I should have a very long
   story to tell you. But this infernal French is too hard, and
   Sigismond Planus is good for nothing away from his figures. So I
   will come to the point at once.

   &ldquo;Affairs in your brother&rsquo;s house are not as they should be. That
   woman is false to him with his partner. She has made her husband a
   laughing-stock, and if this goes on she will cause him to be looked
   upon as a rascal. Frantz, my boy, you must come home at once. You
   are the only one who can speak to Risler and open his eyes about
   that little Sidonie. He would not believe any of us. Ask leave of
   absence at once, and come.

   &ldquo;I know that you have your bread to earn out there, and your future
   to assure; but a man of honor should think more of the name his
   parents gave him than of anything else. And I tell you that if you
   do not come at once, a time will come when the name of Risler will
   be so overwhelmed with shame that you will not dare to bear it.

                  &ldquo;SIGISMOND PLANUS,

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. THE JUDGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Those persons who live always in doors, confined by work or infirmity to a
      chair by the window, take a deep interest in the people who pass, just as
      they make for themselves a horizon of the neighboring walls, roofs, and
      windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nailed to their place, they live in the life of the streets; and the busy
      men and women who pass within their range of vision, sometimes every day
      at the same hour, do not suspect that they serve as the mainspring of
      other lives, that interested eyes watch for their coming and miss them if
      they happen to go to their destination by another road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Delobelles, left to themselves all day, indulged in this sort of
      silent observation. Their window was narrow, and the mother, whose eyes
      were beginning to weaken as the result of hard usage, sat near the light
      against the drawn muslin curtain; her daughter&rsquo;s large armchair was a
      little farther away. She announced the approach of their daily passers-by.
      It was a diversion, a subject of conversation; and the long hours of toil
      seemed shorter, marked off by the regular appearance of people who were as
      busy as they. There were two little sisters, a gentleman in a gray
      overcoat, a child who was taken to school and taken home again, and an old
      government clerk with a wooden leg, whose step on the sidewalk had a
      sinister sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      They hardly ever saw him; he passed after dark, but they heard him, and
      the sound always struck the little cripple&rsquo;s ears like a harsh echo of her
      own mournful thoughts. All these street friends unconsciously occupied a
      large place in the lives of the two women. If it rained, they would say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will get wet. I wonder whether the child got home before the
      shower.&rdquo; And when the season changed, when the March sun inundated the
      sidewalks or the December snow covered them with its white mantle and its
      patches of black mud, the appearance of a new garment on one of their
      friends caused the two recluses to say to themselves, &ldquo;It is summer,&rdquo; or,
      &ldquo;winter has come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, on a certain evening in May, one of those soft, luminous evenings
      when life flows forth from the houses into the street through the open
      windows, Desiree and her mother were busily at work with needles and
      fingers, exhausting the daylight to its last ray, before lighting the
      lamp. They could hear the shouts of children playing in the yards, the
      muffled notes of pianos, and the voice of a street peddler, drawing his
      half-empty wagon. One could smell the springtime in the air, a vague odor
      of hyacinth and lilac.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mamma Delobelle had laid aside her work, and, before closing the window,
      leaned upon the sill listening to all these noises of a great toiling
      city, taking delight in walking through the streets when its day&rsquo;s work
      was ended. From time to time she spoke to her daughter, without turning
      her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! there&rsquo;s Monsieur Sigismond. How early he leaves the factory to-night!
      It may be because the days are lengthening so fast, but I don&rsquo;t think it
      can be seven o&rsquo;clock. Who can that man be with the old cashier?&mdash;What
      a funny thing!&mdash;One would say&mdash;Why, yes!&mdash;One would say it
      was Monsieur Frantz. But that isn&rsquo;t possible. Monsieur Frantz is a long
      way from here at this moment; and then he had no beard. That man looks
      like him all the same! Just look, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But &ldquo;my dear&rdquo; does not leave her chair; she does not even stir. With her
      eyes staring into vacancy, her needle in the air, arrested in its pretty,
      industrious movement, she has gone away to the blue country, that
      wonderful country whither one may go at will, without thought of any
      infirmity. The name &ldquo;Frantz,&rdquo; uttered mechanically by her mother, because
      of a chance resemblance, represented to her a whole lifetime of illusions,
      of fervent hopes, ephemeral as the flush that rose to her cheeks when, on
      returning home at night, he used to come and chat with her a moment. How
      far away that was already! To think that he used to live in the little
      room near hers, that they used to hear his step on the stairs and the
      noise made by his table when he dragged it to the window to draw! What
      sorrow and what happiness she used to feel when he talked to her of
      Sidonie, sitting on the low chair at her knees, while she mounted her
      birds and her insects.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she worked, she used to cheer and comfort him, for Sidonie had caused
      poor Frantz many little griefs before the last great one. His tone when he
      spoke of Sidonie, the sparkle in his eyes when he thought of her,
      fascinated Desiree in spite of everything, so that when he went away in
      despair, he left behind him a love even greater than that he carried with
      him&mdash;a love which the unchanging room, the sedentary, stagnant life,
      kept intact with all its bitter perfume, whereas his would gradually fade
      away and vanish in the fresh air of the outer world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It grows darker and darker. A great wave of melancholy envelops the poor
      girl with the falling darkness of that balmy evening. The blissful gleam
      from the past dies away as the last glimmer of daylight vanishes in the
      narrow recess of the window, where her mother still stands leaning on the
      sill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the door opens. Some one is there whose features can not be
      distinguished. Who can it be? The Delobelles never receive calls. The
      mother, who has turned her head, thinks at first that some one has come
      from the shop to get the week&rsquo;s work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband has just gone to your place, Monsieur. We have nothing here.
      Monsieur Delobelle has taken everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man comes forward without speaking, and as he approaches the window
      his features can be distinguished. He is a tall, solidly built fellow with
      a bronzed face, a thick, red beard, and a deep voice, and is a little slow
      of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! so you don&rsquo;t know me, Mamma Delobelle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I knew you at once, Monsieur Frantz,&rdquo; said Desiree, very calmly, in a
      cold, sedate tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merciful heavens! it&rsquo;s Monsieur Frantz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quickly Mamma Delobelle runs to the lamp, lights it, and closes the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! it is you, is it, my dear Frantz?&rdquo; How coolly she says it, the
      little rascal! &ldquo;I knew you at once.&rdquo; Ah, the little iceberg! She will
      always be the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      A veritable little iceberg, in very truth. She is very pale, and her hand
      as it lies in Frantz&rsquo;s is white and cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seems to him improved, even more refined than before. He seems to her
      superb, as always, with a melancholy, weary expression in the depths of
      his eyes, which makes him more of a man than when he went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      His weariness is due to his hurried journey, undertaken immediately on his
      receipt of Sigismond&rsquo;s letter. Spurred on by the word dishonor, he had
      started instantly, without awaiting his leave of absence, risking his
      place and his future prospects; and, hurrying from steamships to railways,
      he had not stopped until he reached Paris. Reason enough for being weary,
      especially when one has travelled in eager haste to reach one&rsquo;s
      destination, and when one&rsquo;s mind has been continually beset by impatient
      thoughts, making the journey ten times over in incessant doubt and fear
      and perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      His melancholy began further back. It began on the day when the woman he
      loved refused to marry him, to become, six months later, the wife of his
      brother; two terrible blows in close succession, the second even more
      painful than the first. It is true that, before entering into that
      marriage, Risler had written to him to ask his permission to be happy, and
      had written in such touching, affectionate terms that the violence of the
      blow was somewhat diminished; and then, in due time, life in a strange
      country, hard work, and long journeys had softened his grief. Now only a
      vast background of melancholy remains; unless, indeed, the hatred and
      wrath by which he is animated at this moment against the woman who is
      dishonoring his brother may be a remnant of his former love.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no! Frantz Risler thinks only of avenging the honor of the Rislers. He
      comes not as a lover, but as a judge; and Sidonie may well look to
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge had gone straight to the factory on leaving the train, relying
      upon the surprise, the unexpectedness, of his arrival to disclose to him
      at a glance what was taking place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unluckily he had found no one. The blinds of the little house at the foot
      of the garden had been closed for two weeks. Pere Achille informed him
      that the ladies were at their respective country seats where the partners
      joined them every evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fromont Jeune had left the factory very early; Risler Aine had just gone.
      Frantz decided to speak to old Sigismond. But it was Saturday, the regular
      pay-day, and he must needs wait until the long line of workmen, extending
      from Achille&rsquo;s lodge to the cashier&rsquo;s grated window, had gradually
      dispersed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although very impatient and very depressed, the excellent youth, who had
      lived the life of a Paris workingman from his childhood, felt a thrill of
      pleasure at finding himself once more in the midst of the animated scenes
      peculiar to that time and place. Upon all those faces, honest or vicious,
      was an expression of satisfaction that the week was at an end. You felt
      that, so far as they were concerned, Sunday began at seven o&rsquo;clock
      Saturday evening, in front of the cashier&rsquo;s little lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      One must have lived among workingmen to realize the full charm of that one
      day&rsquo;s rest and its solemnity. Many of these poor creatures, bound fast to
      unhealthful trades, await the coming of the blessed Sunday like a puff of
      refreshing air, essential to their health and their life. What an overflow
      of spirits, therefore, what a pressing need of noisy mirth! It seems as if
      the oppression of the week&rsquo;s labor vanishes with the steam from the
      machinery, as it escapes in a hissing cloud of vapor over the gutters.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one the workmen moved away from the grating, counting the money
      that glistened in their black hands. There were disappointments,
      mutterings, remonstrances, hours missed, money drawn in advance; and above
      the tinkling of coins, Sigismond&rsquo;s voice could be heard, calm and
      relentless, defending the interests of his employers with a zeal amounting
      to ferocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frantz was familiar with all the dramas of pay-day, the false accents and
      the true. He knew that one man&rsquo;s wages were expended for his family, to
      pay the baker and the druggist, or for his children&rsquo;s schooling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another wanted his money for the wine-shop or for something even worse.
      And the melancholy, downcast shadows passing to and fro in front of the
      factory gateway&mdash;he knew what they were waiting for&mdash;that they
      were all on the watch for a father or a husband, to hurry him home with
      complaining or coaxing words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! the barefooted children, the tiny creatures wrapped in old shawls, the
      shabby women, whose tear-stained faces were as white as the linen caps
      that surmounted them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! the lurking vice that prowls about on pay-day, the candles that are
      lighted in the depths of dark alleys, the dirty windows of the wine-shops
      where the thousand-and-one poisonous concoctions of alcohol display their
      alluring colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frantz was familiar with all these forms of misery; but never had they
      seemed to him so depressing, so harrowing as on that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the last man was paid, Sigismond came out of his office. The two
      friends recognized each other and embraced; and in the silence of the
      factory, at rest for twenty-four hours and deathly still in all its empty
      buildings, the cashier explained to Frantz the state of affairs. He
      described Sidonie&rsquo;s conduct, her mad extravagance, the total wreck of the
      family honor. The Rislers had bought a country house at Asnieres, formerly
      the property of an actress, and had set up a sumptuous establishment
      there. They had horses and carriages, and led a luxurious, gay life. The
      thing that especially disturbed honest Sigismond was the self restraint of
      Fromont jeune. For some time he had drawn almost no money from the
      strong-box, and yet Sidonie was spending more than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haf no gonfidence!&rdquo; said the unhappy cashier, shaking his head, &ldquo;I haf
      no gonfidence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lowering his voice he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your brother, my little Frantz, your brother? Who can explain his
      actions? He goes about through it all with his eyes in the air, his hands
      in his pockets, his mind on his famous invention, which unfortunately
      doesn&rsquo;t move fast. Look here! do you want me to give you my opinion?&mdash;He&rsquo;s
      either a knave or a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were walking up and down the little garden as they talked, stopping
      for a moment, then resuming their walk. Frantz felt as if he were living
      in a horrible dream. The rapid journey, the sudden change of scene and
      climate, the ceaseless flow of Sigismond&rsquo;s words, the new idea that he had
      to form of Risler and Sidonie&mdash;the same Sidonie he had loved so
      dearly&mdash;all these things bewildered him and almost drove him mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late. Night was falling. Sigismond proposed to him to go to
      Montrouge for the night; he declined on the plea of fatigue, and when he
      was left alone in the Marais, at that dismal and uncertain hour when the
      daylight has faded and the gas is still unlighted, he walked instinctively
      toward his old quarters on the Rue de Braque.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the hall door hung a placard: Bachelor&rsquo;s Chamber to let.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the same room in which he had lived so long with his brother. He
      recognized the map fastened to the wall by four pins, the window on the
      landing, and the Delobelles&rsquo; little sign: &lsquo;Birds and Insects for
      Ornament.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Their door was ajar; he had only to push it a little in order to enter the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly there was not in all Paris a surer refuge for him, a spot better
      fitted to welcome and console his perturbed spirit, than that hard-working
      familiar fireside. In his present agitation and perplexity it was like the
      harbor with its smooth, deep water, the sunny, peaceful quay, where the
      women work while awaiting their husbands and fathers, though the wind
      howls and the sea rages. More than all else, although he did not realize
      that it was so, it was a network of steadfast affection, that miraculous
      love-kindness which makes another&rsquo;s love precious to us even when we do
      not love that other.
    </p>
    <p>
      That dear little iceberg of a Desiree loved him so dearly. Her eyes
      sparkled so even when talking of the most indifferent things with him. As
      objects dipped in phosphorus shine with equal splendor, so the most
      trivial words she said illuminated her pretty, radiant face. What a
      blissful rest it was for him after Sigismond&rsquo;s brutal disclosures!
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked together with great animation while Mamma Delobelle was
      setting the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will dine with us, won&rsquo;t you, Monsieur Frantz? Father has gone to
      take back the work; but he will surely come home to dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He will surely come home to dinner!
    </p>
    <p>
      The good woman said it with a certain pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, since the failure of his managerial scheme, the illustrious
      Delobelle no longer took his meals abroad, even on the evenings when he
      went to collect the weekly earnings. The unlucky manager had eaten so many
      meals on credit at his restaurant that he dared not go there again. By way
      of compensation, he never failed, on Saturday, to bring home with him two
      or three unexpected, famished guests&mdash;&ldquo;old comrades&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;unlucky
      devils.&rdquo; So it happened that, on the evening in question, he appeared upon
      the stage escorting a financier from the Metz theatre and a comique from
      the theatre at Angers, both waiting for an engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The comique, closely shaven, wrinkled, shrivelled by the heat from the
      footlights, looked like an old street-arab; the financier wore cloth
      shoes, and no linen, so far as could be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frantz!&mdash;my Frantz!&rdquo; cried the old strolling player in a
      melodramatic voice, clutching the air convulsively with his hands. After a
      long and energetic embrace he presented his guests to one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Robricart, of the theatre at Metz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Chaudezon, of the theatre at Angers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frantz Risler, engineer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In Delobelle&rsquo;s mouth that word &ldquo;engineer&rdquo; assumed vast proportions!
    </p>
    <p>
      Desiree pouted prettily when she saw her father&rsquo;s friends. It would have
      been so nice to be by themselves on a day like to-day. But the great man
      snapped his fingers at the thought. He had enough to do to unload his
      pockets. First of all, he produced a superb pie &ldquo;for the ladies,&rdquo; he said,
      forgetting that he adored pie. A lobster next made its appearance, then an
      Arles sausage, marrons glaces and cherries, the first of the season!
    </p>
    <p>
      While the financier enthusiastically pulled up the collar of his invisible
      shirt, while the comique exclaimed &ldquo;gnouf! gnouf!&rdquo; with a gesture
      forgotten by Parisians for ten years, Desiree thought with dismay of the
      enormous hole that impromptu banquet would make in the paltry earnings of
      the week, and Mamma Delobelle, full of business, upset the whole buffet in
      order to find a sufficient number of plates.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very lively meal. The two actors ate voraciously, to the great
      delight of Delobelle, who talked over with them old memories of their days
      of strolling. Fancy a collection of odds and ends of scenery, extinct
      lanterns, and mouldy, crumbling stage properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a sort of vulgar, meaningless, familiar slang, they recalled their
      innumerable triumphs; for all three of them, according to their own
      stories, had been applauded, laden with laurel-wreaths, and carried in
      triumph by whole cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they talked they ate as actors usually eat, sitting with their faces
      turned three-fourths toward the audience, with the unnatural haste of
      stage guests at a pasteboard supper, alternating words and mouthfuls,
      seeking to produce an effect by their manner of putting down a glass or
      moving a chair, and expressing interest, amazement, joy, terror, surprise,
      with the aid of a skilfully handled knife and fork. Madame Delobelle
      listened to them with a smiling face.
    </p>
    <p>
      One can not be an actor&rsquo;s wife for thirty years without becoming somewhat
      accustomed to these peculiar mannerisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one little corner of the table was separated from the rest of the
      party as by a cloud which intercepted the absurd remarks, the hoarse
      laughter, the boasting. Frantz and Desiree talked together in undertones,
      hearing naught of what was said around them. Things that happened in their
      childhood, anecdotes of the neighborhood, a whole ill-defined past which
      derived its only value from the mutual memories evoked, from the spark
      that glowed in the eyes of both-those were the themes of their pleasant
      chat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the cloud was torn aside, and Delobelle&rsquo;s terrible voice
      interrupted the dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you not seen your brother?&rdquo; he asked, in order to avoid the
      appearance of neglecting him too much. &ldquo;And you have not seen his wife,
      either? Ah! you will find her a Madame. Such toilettes, my dear fellow,
      and such chic! I assure you. They have a genuine chateau at Asnieres. The
      Chebes are there also. Ah! my old friend, they have all left us behind.
      They are rich, they look down on old friends. Never a word, never a call.
      For my part, you understand, I snap my fingers at them, but it really
      wounds these ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, papa!&rdquo; said Desiree hastily, &ldquo;you know very well that we are too fond
      of Sidonie to be offended with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The actor smote the table a violent blow with his fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, you do wrong. You ought to be offended with people who seek
      always to wound and humiliate you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He still had upon his mind the refusal to furnish funds for his theatrical
      project, and he made no secret of his wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you knew,&rdquo; he said to Frantz, &ldquo;if you knew how money is being
      squandered over yonder! It is a great pity. And nothing substantial,
      nothing sensible. I who speak to you, asked your brother for a paltry sum
      to assure my future and himself a handsome profit. He flatly refused.
      Parbleu! Madame requires too much. She rides, goes to the races in her
      carriage, and drives her husband at the same rate as her little phaeton on
      the quay at Asnieres. Between you and me, I don&rsquo;t think that our good
      friend Risler is very happy. That woman makes him believe black is white.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ex-actor concluded his harangue with a wink at the comique and the
      financier, and for a moment the three exchanged glances, conventional
      grimaces, &lsquo;ha-has!&rsquo; and &lsquo;hum-hums!&rsquo; and all the usual pantomime expressive
      of thoughts too deep for words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frantz was struck dumb. Do what he would, the horrible certainty assailed
      him on all sides. Sigismond had spoken in accordance with his nature,
      Delobelle with his. The result was the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately the dinner was drawing near its close. The three actors left
      the table and betook themselves to the brewery on the Rue Blondel. Frantz
      remained with the two women.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he sat beside her, gentle and affectionate in manner, Desiree was
      suddenly conscious of a great outflow of gratitude to Sidonie. She said to
      herself that, after all, it was to her generosity that she owed this
      semblance of happiness, and that thought gave her courage to defend her
      former friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Monsieur Frantz, you mustn&rsquo;t believe all my father told you
      about your sister-in-law. Dear papa! he always exaggerates a little. For
      my own part, I am very sure that Sidonie is incapable of all the evil she
      is accused of. I am sure that her heart has remained the same; and that
      she is still fond of her friends, although she does neglect them a little.
      Such is life, you know. Friends drift apart without meaning to. Isn&rsquo;t that
      true, Monsieur Frantz?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh! how pretty she was in his eyes, while she talked in that strain. He
      never had taken so much notice of the refined features, the aristocratic
      pallor of her complexion; and when he left her that evening, deeply
      touched by the warmth she had displayed in defending Sidonie, by all the
      charming feminine excuses she put forward for her friend&rsquo;s silence and
      neglect, Frantz Risler reflected, with a feeling of selfish and ingenuous
      pleasure, that the child had loved him once, and that perhaps she loved
      him still, and kept for him in the bottom of her heart that warm,
      sheltered spot to which we turn as to the sanctuary when life has wounded
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      All night long in his old room, lulled by the imaginary movement of the
      vessel, by the murmur of the waves and the howling of the wind which
      follow long sea voyages, he dreamed of his youthful days, of little Chebe
      and Desiree Delobelle, of their games, their labors, and of the Ecole
      Centrale, whose great, gloomy buildings were sleeping near at hand, in the
      dark streets of the Marais.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when daylight came, and the sun shining in at his bare window vexed
      his eyes and brought him back to a realization of the duty that lay before
      him and to the anxieties of the day, he dreamed that it was time to go to
      the School, and that his brother, before going down to the factory, opened
      the door and called to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, lazybones! Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That dear, loving voice, too natural, too real for a dream, made him open
      his eyes without more ado.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler was standing by his bed, watching his awakening with a charming
      smile, not untinged by emotion; that it was Risler himself was evident
      from the fact that, in his joy at seeing his brother Frantz once more, he
      could find nothing better to say than, &ldquo;I am very happy, I am very happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although it was Sunday, Risler, as was his custom, had come to the factory
      to avail himself of the silence and solitude to work at his press.
      Immediately on his arrival, Pere Achille had informed him that his brother
      was in Paris and had gone to the old house on the Rue de Braque, and he
      had hastened thither in joyful surprise, a little vexed that he had not
      been forewarned, and especially that Frantz had defrauded him of the first
      evening. His regret on that account came to the surface every moment in
      his spasmodic attempts at conversation, in which everything that he wanted
      to say was left unfinished, interrupted by innumerable questions on all
      sorts of subjects and explosions of affection and joy. Frantz excused
      himself on the plea of fatigue, and the pleasure it had given him to be in
      their old room once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, all right,&rdquo; said Risler, &ldquo;but I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t let you alone now&mdash;you
      are coming to Asnieres at once. I give myself leave of absence today. All
      thought of work is out of the question now that you have come, you
      understand. Ah! won&rsquo;t the little one be surprised and glad! We talk about
      you so often! What joy! what joy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor fellow fairly beamed with happiness; he, the silent man,
      chattered like a magpie, gazed admiringly at his Frantz and remarked upon
      his growth. The pupil of the Ecole Centrale had had a fine physique when
      he went away, but his features had acquired greater firmness, his
      shoulders were broader, and it was a far cry from the tall,
      studious-looking boy who had left Paris two years before, for Ismailia, to
      this handsome, bronzed corsair, with his serious yet winning face.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Risler was gazing at him, Frantz, on his side, was closely
      scrutinizing his brother, and, finding him the same as always, as
      ingenuous, as loving, and as absent-minded as times, he said to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! it is not possible&mdash;he has not ceased to be an honest man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, as he reflected upon what people had dared to imagine, all his
      wrath turned against that hypocritical, vicious woman, who deceived her
      husband so impudently and with such absolute impunity that she succeeded
      in causing him to be considered her confederate. Oh! what a terrible
      reckoning he proposed to have with her; how pitilessly he would talk to
      her!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forbid you, Madame&mdash;understand what I say&mdash;I forbid you to
      dishonor my brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was thinking of that all the way, as he watched the still leafless
      trees glide along the embankment of the Saint-Germain railway. Sitting
      opposite him, Risler chattered, chattered without pause. He talked about
      the factory, about their business. They had gained forty thousand francs
      each the last year; but it would be a different matter when the Press was
      at work. &ldquo;A rotary press, my little Frantz, rotary and dodecagonal,
      capable of printing a pattern in twelve to fifteen colors at a single turn
      of the wheel&mdash;red on pink, dark green on light green, without the
      least running together or absorption, without a line lapping over its
      neighbor, without any danger of one shade destroying or overshadowing
      another. Do you understand that, little brother? A machine that is an
      artist like a man. It means a revolution in the wallpaper trade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; queried Frantz with some anxiety, &ldquo;have you invented this Press of
      yours yet, or are you still hunting for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Invented!&mdash;perfected! To-morrow I will show you all my plans. I have
      also invented an automatic crane for hanging the paper on the rods in the
      drying-room. Next week I intend to take up my quarters in the factory, up
      in the garret, and have my first machine made there secretly, under my own
      eyes. In three months the patents must be taken out and the Press must be
      at work. You&rsquo;ll see, my little Frantz, it will make us all rich-you can
      imagine how glad I shall be to be able to make up to these Fromonts for a
      little of what they have done for me. Ah! upon my word, the Lord has been
      too good to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon he began to enumerate all his blessings. Sidonie was the best of
      women, a little love of a wife, who conferred much honor upon him. They
      had a charming home. They went into society, very select society. The
      little one sang like a nightingale, thanks to Madame Dobson&rsquo;s expressive
      method. By the way, this Madame Dobson was another most excellent
      creature. There was just one thing that disturbed poor Risler, that was
      his incomprehensible misunderstanding with Sigismond. Perhaps Frantz could
      help him to clear up that mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, I will help you, brother,&rdquo; replied Frantz through his clenched
      teeth; and an angry flush rose to his brow at the idea that any one could
      have suspected the open-heartedness, the loyalty, that were displayed
      before him in all their artless spontaneity. Luckily he, the judge, had
      arrived; and he proposed to restore everything to its proper place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, they were drawing near the house at Asnieres. Frantz had
      noticed at a distance a fanciful little turreted affair, glistening with a
      new blue slate roof. It seemed to him to have been built expressly for
      Sidonie, a fitting cage for that capricious, gaudy-plumaged bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a chalet with two stories, whose bright mirrors and pink-lined
      curtains could be seen from the railway, shining resplendent at the far
      end of a green lawn, where an enormous pewter ball was suspended.
    </p>
    <p>
      The river was near at hand, still wearing its Parisian aspect, filled with
      chains, bathing establishments, great barges, and multitudes of little,
      skiffs, with a layer of coal dust on their pretentious, freshly-painted
      names, tied to the pier and rocking to the slightest motion of the water.
      From her windows Sidonie could see the restaurants on the beach, silent
      through the week, but filled to overflowing on Sunday with a motley, noisy
      crowd, whose shouts of laughter, mingled with the dull splash of oars,
      came from both banks to meet in midstream in that current of vague
      murmurs, shouts, calls, laughter, and singing that floats without ceasing
      up and down the Seine on holidays for a distance of ten miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the week she saw shabbily-dressed idlers sauntering along the
      shore, men in broad-brimmed straw hats and flannel shirts, women who sat
      on the worn grass of the sloping bank, doing nothing, with the dreamy eyes
      of a cow at pasture. All the peddlers, hand-organs, harpists; travelling
      jugglers, stopped there as at a quarantine station. The quay was crowded
      with them, and as they approached, the windows in the little houses near
      by were always thrown open, disclosing white dressing-jackets,
      half-buttoned, heads of dishevelled hair, and an occasional pipe, all
      watching these paltry strolling shows, as if with a sigh of regret for
      Paris, so near at hand. It was a hideous and depressing sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grass, which had hardly begun to grow, was already turning yellow
      beneath the feet of the crowd. The dust was black; and yet, every
      Thursday, the cocotte aristocracy passed through on the way to the Casino,
      with a great show of rickety carriages and borrowed postilions. All these
      things gave pleasure to that fanatical Parisian, Sidonie; and then, too,
      in her childhood, she had heard a great deal about Asnieres from the
      illustrious Delobelle, who would have liked to have, like so many of his
      profession, a little villa in those latitudes, a cozy nook in the country
      to which to return by the midnight train, after the play is done.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these dreams of little Chebe, Sidonie Risler had realized.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brothers went to the gate opening on the quay, in which the key was
      usually left. They entered, making their way among trees and shrubs of
      recent growth. Here and there the billiard-room, the gardener&rsquo;s lodge, a
      little greenhouse, made their appearance, like the pieces of one of the
      Swiss chalets we give to children to play with; all very light and
      fragile, hardly more than resting on the ground, as if ready to fly away
      at the slightest breath of bankruptcy or caprice: the villa of a cocotte
      or a pawnbroker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frantz looked about in some bewilderment. In the distance, opening on a
      porch surrounded by vases of flowers, was the salon with its long blinds
      raised. An American easy-chair, folding-chairs, a small table from which
      the coffee had not been removed, could be seen near the door. Within they
      heard a succession of loud chords on the piano and the murmur of low
      voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you Sidonie will be surprised,&rdquo; said honest Risler, walking softly
      on the gravel; &ldquo;she doesn&rsquo;t expect me until tonight. She and Madame Dobson
      are practising together at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pushing the door open suddenly, he cried from the threshold in his loud,
      good-natured voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess whom I&rsquo;ve brought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Dobson, who was sitting alone at the piano, jumped up from her
      stool, and at the farther end of the grand salon Georges and Sidonie rose
      hastily behind the exotic plants that reared their heads above a table, of
      whose delicate, slender lines they seemed a prolongation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! how you frightened me!&rdquo; said Sidonie, running to meet Risler.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flounces of her white peignoir, through which blue ribbons were drawn,
      like little patches of blue sky among the clouds, rolled in billows over
      the carpet, and, having already recovered from her embarrassment, she
      stood very straight, with an affable expression and her everlasting little
      smile, as she kissed her husband and offered her forehead to Frantz,
      saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Risler left them confronting each other, and went up to Fromont Jeune,
      whom he was greatly surprised to find there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Chorche, you here? I supposed you were at Savigny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to be sure, but&mdash;I came&mdash;I thought you stayed at Asnieres
      Sundays. I wanted to speak to you on a matter of business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, entangling himself in his words, he began to talk hurriedly of
      an important order. Sidonie had disappeared after exchanging a few
      unmeaning words with the impassive Frantz. Madame Dobson continued her
      tremolos on the soft pedal, like those which accompany critical situations
      at the theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      In very truth, the situation at that moment was decidedly strained. But
      Risler&rsquo;s good-humor banished all constraint. He apologized to his partner
      for not being at home, and insisted upon showing Frantz the house. They
      went from the salon to the stable, from the stable to the carriage-house,
      the servants&rsquo; quarters, and the conservatory. Everything was new,
      brilliant, gleaming, too small, and inconvenient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Risler, with a certain pride, &ldquo;it cost a heap of money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He persisted in compelling admiration of Sidonie&rsquo;s purchase even to its
      smallest details, exhibited the gas and water fixtures on every floor, the
      improved system of bells, the garden seats, the English billiard-table,
      the hydropathic arrangements, and accompanied his exposition with
      outbursts of gratitude to Fromont Jeune, who, by taking him into
      partnership, had literally placed a fortune in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      At each new effusion on Risler&rsquo;s part, Georges Fromont shrank visibly,
      ashamed and embarrassed by the strange expression on Frantz&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast was lacking in gayety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Dobson talked almost without interruption, overjoyed to be swimming
      in the shallows of a romantic love-affair. Knowing, or rather believing
      that she knew her friend&rsquo;s story from beginning to end, she understood the
      lowering wrath of Frantz, a former lover furious at finding his place
      filled, and the anxiety of Georges, due to the appearance of a rival; and
      she encouraged one with a glance, consoled the other with a smile, admired
      Sidonie&rsquo;s tranquil demeanor, and reserved all her contempt for that
      abominable Risler, the vulgar, uncivilized tyrant. She made an effort to
      prevent any of those horrible periods of silence, when the clashing knives
      and forks mark time in such an absurd and embarrassing way.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as breakfast was at an end Fromont Jeune announced that he must
      return to Savigny. Risler did not venture to detain him, thinking that his
      dear Madame Chorche would pass her Sunday all alone; and so, without an
      opportunity to say a word to his mistress, the lover went away in the
      bright sunlight to take an afternoon train, still attended by the husband,
      who insisted upon escorting him to the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Dobson sat for a moment with Frantz and Sidonie under a little
      arbor which a climbing vine studded with pink buds; then, realizing that
      she was in the way, she returned to the salon, and as before, while
      Georges was there, began to play and sing softly and with expression. In
      the silent garden, that muffled music, gliding between the branches,
      seemed like the cooing of birds before the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they were alone. Under the lattice of the arbor, still bare and
      leafless, the May sun shone too bright. Sidonie shaded her eyes with her
      hand as she watched the people passing on the quay. Frantz likewise looked
      out, but in another direction; and both of them, affecting to be entirely
      independent of each other, turned at the same instant with the same
      gesture and moved by the same thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have something to say to you,&rdquo; he said, just as she opened her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I to you,&rdquo; she replied gravely; &ldquo;but come in here; we shall be more
      comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they entered together a little summer-house at the foot of the garden.

      CHAPTER XIV. EXPLANATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      By slow degrees Sidonie sank to her former level, yes, even lower. From
      the rich, well-considered bourgeoise to which her marriage had raised her,
      she descended the ladder to the rank of a mere toy. By dint of travelling
      in railway carriages with fantastically dressed courtesans, with their
      hair worn over their eyes like a terrier&rsquo;s, or falling over the back &lsquo;a la
      Genevieve de Brabant&rsquo;, she came at last to resemble them. She transformed
      herself into a blonde for two months, to the unbounded amazement of Rizer,
      who could not understand how his doll was so changed. As for Georges, all
      these eccentricities amused him; it seemed to him that he had ten women in
      one. He was the real husband, the master of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      To divert Sidonie&rsquo;s thoughts, he had provided a simulacrum of society for
      her&mdash;his bachelor friends, a few fast tradesmen, almost no women,
      women have too sharp eyes. Madame Dobson was the only friend of Sidonie&rsquo;s
      sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      They organized grand dinner-parties, excursions on the water, fireworks.
      From day to day Risler&rsquo;s position became more absurd, more distressing.
      When he came home in the evening, tired out, shabbily dressed, he must
      hurry up to his room to dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have some people to dinner,&rdquo; his wife would say. &ldquo;Make haste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he would be the last to take his place at the table, after shaking
      hands all around with his guests, friends of Fromont Jeune, whom he hardly
      knew by name. Strange to say, the affairs of the factory were often
      discussed at that table, to which Georges brought his acquaintances from
      the club with the tranquil self-assurance of the gentleman who pays.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business breakfasts and dinners!&rdquo; To Risler&rsquo;s mind that phrase explained
      everything: his partner&rsquo;s constant presence, his choice of guests, and the
      marvellous gowns worn by Sidonie, who beautified herself in the interests
      of the firm. This coquetry on his mistress&rsquo;s part drove Fromont Jeune to
      despair. Day after day he came unexpectedly to take her by surprise,
      uneasy, suspicious, afraid to leave that perverse and deceitful character
      to its own devices for long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the deuce has become of your husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pere Gardinois would ask his grand-daughter with a cunning leer. &ldquo;Why
      doesn&rsquo;t he come here oftener?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Claire apologized for Georges, but his continual neglect began to disturb
      her. She wept now when she received the little notes, the despatches which
      arrived daily at the dinner-hour: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t expect me to-night, dear love. I
      shall not be able to come to Savigny until to-morrow or the day after by
      the night-train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ate her dinner sadly, opposite an empty chair, and although she did
      not know that she was betrayed, she felt that her husband was becoming
      accustomed to living away from her. He was so absent-minded when a family
      gathering or some other unavoidable duty detained him at the chateau, so
      silent concerning what was in his mind. Claire, having now only the most
      distant relations with Sidonie, knew nothing of what was taking place at
      Asnieres: but when Georges left her, apparently eager to be gone, and with
      smiling face, she tormented her loneliness with unavowed suspicions, and,
      like all those who anticipate a great sorrow, she suddenly became
      conscious of a great void in her heart, a place made ready for disasters
      to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband was hardly happier than she. That cruel Sidonie seemed to take
      pleasure in tormenting him. She allowed everybody to pay court to her. At
      that moment a certain Cazabon, alias Cazaboni, an Italian tenor from
      Toulouse, introduced by Madame Dobson, came every day to sing disturbing
      duets. Georges, jealous beyond words, hurried to Asnieres in the
      afternoon, neglecting everything, and was already beginning to think that
      Risler did not watch his wife closely enough. He would have liked him to
      be blind only so far as he was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! if he had been her husband, what a tight rein he would have kept on
      her! But he had no power over her and she was not at all backward about
      telling him so. Sometimes, too, with the invincible logic that often
      occurs to the greatest fools, he reflected that, as he was deceiving his
      friend, perhaps he deserved to be deceived. In short, his was a wretched
      life. He passed his time running about to jewellers and dry-goods dealers,
      inventing gifts and surprises. Ah! he knew her well. He knew that he could
      pacify her with trinkets, yet not retain his hold upon her, and that, when
      the day came that she was bored&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sidonie was not bored as yet. She was living the life that she longed
      to live; she had all the happiness she could hope to attain. There was
      nothing passionate or romantic about her feeling for Georges. He was like
      a second husband to her, younger and, above all, richer than the other. To
      complete the vulgarization of their liaison, she had summoned her parents
      to Asnieres, lodged them in a little house in the country, and made of
      that vain and wilfully blind father and that affectionate, still
      bewildered mother a halo of respectability of which she felt the necessity
      as she sank lower and lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything was shrewdly planned in that perverse little brain, which
      reflected coolly upon vice; and it seemed to her as if she might continue
      to live thus in peace, when Frantz Risler suddenly arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simply from seeing him enter the room, she had realized that her repose
      was threatened, that an interview of the gravest importance was to take
      place between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her plan was formed on the instant. She must at once put it into
      execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer-house that they entered contained one large, circular room with
      four windows, each looking out upon a different landscape; it was
      furnished for the purposes of summer siestas, for the hot hours when one
      seeks shelter from the sunlight and the noises of the garden. A broad,
      very low divan ran all around the wall. A small lacquered table, also very
      low, stood in the middle of the room, covered with odd numbers of society
      journals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hangings were new, and the Persian pattern-birds flying among bluish
      reeds&mdash;produced the effect of a dream in summer, ethereal figures
      floating before one&rsquo;s languid eyes. The lowered blinds, the matting on the
      floor, the Virginia jasmine clinging to the trellis-work outside, produced
      a refreshing coolness which was enhanced by the splashing in the river
      near by, and the lapping of its wavelets on the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidonie sat down as soon as she entered the room, pushing aside her long
      white skirt, which sank like a mass of snow at the foot of the divan; and
      with sparkling eyes and a smile playing about her lips, bending her little
      head slightly, its saucy coquettishness heightened by the bow of ribbon on
      the side, she waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frantz, pale as death, remained standing, looking about the room. After a
      moment he began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate you, Madame; you understand how to make yourself
      comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in the next breath, as if he were afraid that the conversation,
      beginning at such a distance, would not arrive quickly enough at the point
      to which he intended to lead it, he added brutally:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom do you owe this magnificence, to your lover or your husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without moving from the divan, without even raising her eyes to his, she
      answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was a little disconcerted by such self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you confess that that man is your lover?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confess it!&mdash;yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frantz gazed at her a moment without speaking. She, too, had turned pale,
      notwithstanding her calmness, and the eternal little smile no longer
      quivered at the corners of her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Sidonie! My brother&rsquo;s name, the name he gave his wife, is
      mine as well. Since Risler is so foolish, so blind as to allow the name to
      be dishonored by you, it is my place to defend it against your attacks. I
      beg you, therefore, to inform Monsieur Georges Fromont that he must change
      mistresses as soon as possible, and go elsewhere to ruin himself. If not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If not?&rdquo; queried Sidonie, who had not ceased to play with her rings while
      he was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If not, I shall tell my brother what is going on in his house, and you
      will be surprised at the Risler whose acquaintance you will make then&mdash;a
      man as violent and ungovernable as he usually is inoffensive. My
      disclosure will kill him perhaps, but you can be sure that he will kill
      you first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! let him kill me. What do I care for that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was said with such a heartbroken, despondent air that Frantz, in
      spite of himself, felt a little pity for that beautiful, fortunate young
      creature, who talked of dying with such self-abandonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you love him so dearly?&rdquo; he said, in an indefinably milder tone. &ldquo;Do
      you love this Fromont so dearly that you prefer to die rather than
      renounce him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew herself up hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Love that fop, that doll, that silly girl in men&rsquo;s clothes? Nonsense!&mdash;I
      took him as I would have taken any other man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I couldn&rsquo;t help it, because I was mad, because I had and still
      have in my heart a criminal love, which I am determined to tear out, no
      matter at what cost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had risen and was speaking with her eyes in his, her lips near his,
      trembling from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      A criminal love?&mdash;Whom did she love, in God&rsquo;s name?
    </p>
    <p>
      Frantz was afraid to question her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although suspecting nothing as yet, he had a feeling that that glance,
      that breath, leaning toward him, were about to make some horrible
      disclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his office of judge made it necessary for him to know all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied in a stifled voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know very well that it is you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was his brother&rsquo;s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two years he had not thought of her except as a sister. In his eyes
      his brother&rsquo;s wife in no way resembled his former fiancee, and it would
      have been a crime to recognize in a single feature of her face the woman
      to whom he had formerly so often said, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now it was she who said that she loved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unhappy judge was thunderstruck, dazed, could find no words in which
      to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, standing before him, waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of those spring days, full of heat and light, to which the
      moisture of recent rains imparts a strange softness and melancholy. The
      air was warm, perfumed by fresh flowers which, on that first day of heat,
      gave forth their fragrance eagerly, like violets hidden in a muff. Through
      its long, open windows the room in which they were inhaled all those
      intoxicating odors. Outside, they could hear the Sunday organs, distant
      shouts on the river, and nearer at hand, in the garden, Madame Dobson&rsquo;s
      amorous, languishing voice, sighing:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;On dit que tu te maries;
          Tu sais que j&rsquo;en puis mouri-i-i-r!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Frantz, I have always loved you,&rdquo; said Sidonie. &ldquo;That love which I
      renounced long ago because I was a young girl&mdash;and young girls do not
      know what they are doing&mdash;that love nothing has ever succeeded in
      destroying or lessening. When I learned that Desiree also loved you, the
      unfortunate, penniless child, in a great outburst of generosity I
      determined to assure her happiness for life by sacrificing my own, and I
      at once turned you away, so that you should go to her. Ah! as soon as you
      had gone, I realized that the sacrifice was beyond my strength. Poor
      little Desiree! How I cursed her in the bottom of my heart! Will you
      believe it? Since that time I have avoided seeing her, meeting her. The
      sight of her caused me too much pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you loved me,&rdquo; asked Frantz, in a low voice, &ldquo;if you loved me, why
      did you marry my brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not waver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To marry Risler was to bring myself nearer to you. I said to myself: &lsquo;I
      could not be his wife. Very well, I will be his sister. At all events, in
      that way it will still be allowable for me to love him, and we shall not
      pass our whole lives as strangers.&rsquo; Alas! those are the innocent dreams a
      girl has at twenty, dreams of which she very soon learns the
      impossibility. I could not love you as a sister, Frantz; I could not
      forget you, either; my marriage prevented that. With another husband I
      might perhaps have succeeded, but with Risler it was terrible. He was
      forever talking about you and your success and your future&mdash;Frantz
      said this; Frantz did that&mdash;He loves you so well, poor fellow! And
      then the most cruel thing to me is that your brother looks like you. There
      is a sort of family resemblance in your features, in your gait, in your
      voices especially, for I have often closed my eyes under his caresses,
      saying to myself, &lsquo;It is he, it is Frantz.&rsquo; When I saw that that wicked
      thought was becoming a source of torment to me, something that I could not
      escape, I tried to find distraction, I consented to listen to this
      Georges, who had been pestering me for a long time, to transform my life
      to one of noise and excitement. But I swear to you, Frantz, that in that
      whirlpool of pleasure into which I then plunged, I never have ceased to
      think of you, and if any one had a right to come here and call me to
      account for my conduct, you certainly are not the one, for you,
      unintentionally, have made me what I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused. Frantz dared not raise his eyes to her face. For a moment past
      she had seemed to him too lovely, too alluring. She was his brother&rsquo;s
      wife!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did he dare speak. The unfortunate youth felt that the old passion was
      despotically taking possession of his heart once more, and that at that
      moment glances, words, everything that burst forth from it would be love.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she was his brother&rsquo;s wife!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! wretched, wretched creatures that we are!&rdquo; exclaimed the poor judge,
      dropping upon the divan beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those few words were in themselves an act of cowardice, a beginning of
      surrender, as if destiny, by showing itself so pitiless, had deprived him
      of the strength to defend himself. Sidonie had placed her hand on his.
      &ldquo;Frantz&mdash;Frantz!&rdquo; she said; and they remained there side by side,
      silent and burning with emotion, soothed by Madame Dobson&rsquo;s romance, which
      reached their ears by snatches through the shrubbery:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;Ton amour, c&rsquo;est ma folie.
          Helas! je n&rsquo;en puis guei-i-i-r.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Suddenly Risler&rsquo;s tall figure appeared in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way, Chebe, this way. They are in the summerhouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the husband entered, escorting his father-in-law and
      mother-in-law, whom he had gone to fetch.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment of effusive greetings and innumerable embraces. You
      should have seen the patronizing air with which M. Chebe scrutinized the
      young man, who was head and shoulders taller than he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my boy, does the Suez Canal progress as you would wish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Chebe, in whose thoughts Frantz had never ceased to be her future
      son-in-law, threw her arms around him, while Risler, tactless as usual in
      his gayety and his enthusiasm, waved his arms, talked of killing several
      fatted calves to celebrate the return of the prodigal son, and roared to
      the singing-mistress in a voice that echoed through the neighboring
      gardens:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Dobson, Madame Dobson&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll allow me, it&rsquo;s a pity for
      you to be singing there. To the devil with sadness for to-day! Play us
      something lively, a good waltz, so that I can take a turn with Madame
      Chebe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Risler, Risler, are you crazy, my son-in-law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, mamma! We must dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And up and down the paths, to the strains of an automatic six-step waltz-a
      genuine valse de Vaucanson&mdash;he dragged his breathless mamma-in-law,
      who stopped at every step to restore to their usual orderliness the
      dangling ribbons of her hat and the lace trimming of her shawl, her lovely
      shawl bought for Sidonie&rsquo;s wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Risler was intoxicated with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Frantz that was an endless, indelible day of agony. Driving, rowing on
      the river, lunch on the grass on the Ile des Ravageurs&mdash;he was spared
      none of the charms of Asnieres; and all the time, in the dazzling sunlight
      of the roads, in the glare reflected by the water, he must laugh and
      chatter, describe his journey, talk of the Isthmus of Suez and the great
      work undertaken there, listen to the whispered complaints of M. Chebe, who
      was still incensed with his children, and to his brother&rsquo;s description of
      the Press. &ldquo;Rotary, my dear Frantz, rotary and dodecagonal!&rdquo; Sidonie left
      the gentlemen to their conversation and seemed absorbed in deep thought.
      From time to time she said a word or two to Madame Dobson, or smiled sadly
      at her, and Frantz, not daring to look at her, followed the motions of her
      blue-lined parasol and of the white flounces of her skirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      How she had changed in two years! How lovely she had grown!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then horrible thoughts came to his mind. There were races at Longchamps
      that day. Carriages passed theirs, rubbed against it, driven by women with
      painted faces, closely veiled. Sitting motionless on the box, they held
      their long whips straight in the air, with doll-like gestures, and nothing
      about them seemed alive except their blackened eyes, fixed on the horses&rsquo; 
      heads. As they passed, people turned to look. Every eye followed them, as
      if drawn by the wind caused by their rapid motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidonie resembled those creatures. She might herself have driven Georges&rsquo; 
      carriage; for Frantz was in Georges&rsquo; carriage. He had drunk Georges&rsquo; wine.
      All the luxurious enjoyment of that family party came from Georges.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was shameful, revolting! He would have liked to shout the whole story
      to his brother. Indeed, it was his duty, as he had come there for that
      express purpose. But he no longer felt the courage to do it. Ah! the
      unhappy judge!
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening after dinner, in the salon open to the fresh breeze from the
      river, Risler begged his wife to sing. He wished her to exhibit all her
      newly acquired accomplishments to Frantz.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sidonie, leaning on the piano, objected with a melancholy air, while
      Madame Dobson ran her fingers over the keys, shaking her long curls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know anything. What do you wish me to sing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ended, however, by being persuaded. Pale, disenchanted, with her mind
      upon other things, in the flickering light of the candles which seemed to
      be burning incense, the air was so heavy with the odor of the hyacinths
      and lilacs in the garden, she began a Creole ballad very popular in
      Louisiana, which Madame Dobson herself had arranged for the voice and
      piano:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;Pauv&rsquo; pitit Mam&rsquo;zelle Zizi,
        C&rsquo;est l&rsquo;amou, l&rsquo;amou qui tourne la tete a li.&rdquo;
 
        [&ldquo;Poor little Mam&rsquo;zelle Zizi,
        &lsquo;Tis love, &lsquo;tis love that turns her head.&rdquo;]
</pre>
    <p>
      And as she told the story of the ill-fated little Zizi, who was driven mad
      by passion, Sidonie had the appearance of a love-sick woman. With what
      heartrending expression, with the cry of a wounded dove, did she repeat
      that refrain, so melancholy and so sweet, in the childlike patois of the
      colonies:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;C&rsquo;est l&rsquo;amou, l&rsquo;amou qui tourne la tete....&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It was enough to drive the unlucky judge mad as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no! The siren had been unfortunate in her choice of a ballad. For, at
      the mere name of Mam&rsquo;zelle Zizi, Frantz was suddenly transported to a
      gloomy chamber in the Marais, a long way from Sidonie&rsquo;s salon, and his
      compassionate heart evoked the image of little Desiree Delobelle, who had
      loved him so long. Until she was fifteen, she never had been called
      anything but Ziree or Zizi, and she was the pauv&rsquo; pitit of the Creole
      ballad to the life, the ever-neglected, ever-faithful lover. In vain now
      did the other sing. Frantz no longer heard her or saw her. He was in that
      poor room, beside the great armchair, on the little low chair on which he
      had sat so often awaiting the father&rsquo;s return. Yes, there, and there only,
      was his salvation. He must take refuge in that child&rsquo;s love, throw himself
      at her feet, say to her, &ldquo;Take me, save me!&rdquo; And who knows? She loved him
      so dearly. Perhaps she would save him, would cure him of his guilty
      passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked Risler, seeing that his brother rose
      hurriedly as soon as the last flourish was at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going back. It is late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? You are not going to sleep here? Why your room is ready for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all ready,&rdquo; added Sidonie, with a meaning glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He refused resolutely. His presence in Paris was necessary for the
      fulfilment of certain very important commissions intrusted to him by the
      Company. They continued their efforts to detain him when he was in the
      vestibule, when he was crossing the garden in the moonlight and running to
      the station, amid all the divers noises of Asnieres.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone, Risler went up to his room, leaving Sidonie and Madame
      Dobson at the windows of the salon. The music from the neighboring Casino
      reached their ears, with the &ldquo;Yo-ho!&rdquo; of the boatmen and the footsteps of
      the dancers like a rhythmical, muffled drumming on the tambourine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a kill-joy for you!&rdquo; observed Madame Dobson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have checkmated him,&rdquo; replied Sidonie; &ldquo;only I must be careful. I
      shall be closely watched now. He is so jealous. I am going to write to
      Cazaboni not to come again for some time, and you must tell Georges
      to-morrow morning to go to Savigny for a fortnight.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. POOR LITTLE MAM&rsquo;ZELLE ZIZI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Oh, how happy Desiree was!
    </p>
    <p>
      Frantz came every day and sat at her feet on the little low chair, as in
      the good old days, and he no longer came to talk of Sidonie.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she began to work in the morning, she would see the door open
      softly. &ldquo;Good morning, Mam&rsquo;zelle Zizi.&rdquo; He always called her now by the
      name she had borne as a child; and if you could know how prettily he said
      it: &ldquo;Good morning, Mam&rsquo;zelle Zizi.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the evening they waited for &ldquo;the father&rdquo; together, and while she worked
      he made her shudder with the story of his adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with you? You&rsquo;re not the same as you used to be,&rdquo;
       Mamma Delobelle would say, surprised to see her in such high spirits and
      above all so active. For instead of remaining always buried in her
      easy-chair, with the self-renunciation of a young grandmother, the little
      creature was continually jumping up and running to the window as lightly
      as if she were putting out wings; and she practised standing erect, asking
      her mother in a whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you notice IT when I am not walking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From her graceful little head, upon which she had previously concentrated
      all her energies in the arrangement of her hair, her coquetry extended
      over her whole person, as did her fine, waving tresses when she unloosed
      them. Yes, she was very, very coquettish now; and everybody noticed it.
      Even the &ldquo;birds and insects for ornament&rdquo; assumed a knowing little air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, yes! Desiree Delobelle was happy. For some days M. Frantz had been
      talking of their all going into the country together; and as the father,
      kind and generous as always, graciously consented to allow the ladies to
      take a day&rsquo;s rest, all four set out one Sunday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! the lovely drive, the lovely country, the lovely river, the lovely
      trees!
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not ask her where they went; Desiree never knew. But she will tell you
      that the sun was brighter there than anywhere else, the birds more joyous,
      the woods denser; and she will not lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bouquet that the little cripple brought back from that beautiful
      excursion made her room fragrant for a week. Among the hyacinths, the
      violets, the white-thorn, was a multitude of nameless little flowers,
      those flowers of the lowly which grow from nomadic seed scattered
      everywhere along the roads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gazing at the slender, pale blue and bright pink blossoms, with all the
      delicate shades that flowers invented before colorists, many and many a
      time during that week Desiree took her excursion again. The violets
      reminded her of the little moss-covered mound on which she had picked
      them, seeking them under the leaves, her fingers touching Frantz&rsquo;s. They
      had found these great water-lilies on the edge of a ditch, still damp from
      the winter rains, and, in order to reach them, she had leaned very heavily
      on Frantz&rsquo;s arm. All these memories occurred to her as she worked.
      Meanwhile the sun, shining in at the open window, made the feathers of the
      hummingbirds glisten. The springtime, youth, the songs of the birds, the
      fragrance of the flowers, transfigured that dismal fifth-floor workroom,
      and Desiree said in all seriousness to Mamma Delobelle, putting her nose
      to her friend&rsquo;s bouquet:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you noticed how sweet the flowers smell this year, mamma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Frantz, too, began to fall under the charm. Little by little Mam&rsquo;zelle
      Zizi took possession of his heart and banished from it even the memory of
      Sidonie. To be sure, the poor judge did all that he could to accomplish
      that result. At every hour in the day he was by Desiree&rsquo;s side, and clung
      to her like a child. Not once did he venture to return to Asnieres. He
      feared the other too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray come and see us once in a while; Sidonie keeps asking for you,&rdquo;
       Risler said to him from time to time, when his brother came to the factory
      to see him. But Frantz held firm, alleging all sorts of business
      engagements as pretexts for postponing his visit to the next day. It was
      easy to satisfy Risler, who was more engrossed than ever with his press,
      which they had just begun to build.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever Frantz came down from his brother&rsquo;s closet, old Sigismond was
      sure to be watching for him, and would walk a few steps with him in his
      long, lute-string sleeves, quill and knife in hand. He kept the young man
      informed concerning matters at the factory. For some time past, things
      seemed to have changed for the better. Monsieur Georges came to his office
      regularly, and returned to Savigny every night. No more bills were
      presented at the counting-room. It seemed, too, that Madame over yonder
      was keeping more within bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cashier was triumphant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, my boy, whether I did well to write to you. Your arrival was all
      that was needed to straighten everything out. And yet,&rdquo; the good man would
      add by force of habit, &ldquo;and yet I haf no gonfidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never fear, Monsieur Sigismond, I am here,&rdquo; the judge would reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going away yet, are you, my dear Frantz?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;not yet. I have an important matter to finish up first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! so much the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The important matter to which Frantz referred was his marriage to Desiree
      Delobelle. He had not yet mentioned it to any one, not even to her; but
      Mam&rsquo;zelle Zizi must have suspected something, for she became prettier and
      more lighthearted from day to day, as if she foresaw that the day would
      soon come when she would need all her gayety and all her beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were alone in the workroom one Sunday afternoon. Mamma Delobelle had
      gone out, proud enough to show herself for once in public with her great
      man, and leaving friend Frantz with her daughter to keep her company.
      Carefully dressed, his whole person denoting a holiday air, Frantz had a
      singular expression on his face that day, an expression at once timid and
      resolute, emotional and solemn, and simply from the way in which the
      little low chair took its place beside the great easy-chair, the
      easy-chair understood that a very serious communication was about to be
      made to it in confidence, and it had some little suspicion as to what it
      might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation began with divers unimportant remarks, interspersed with
      long and frequent pauses, just as, on a journey, we stop at every
      baiting-place to take breath, to enable us to reach our destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a fine day to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our flowers still smell sweet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! very sweet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And even as they uttered those trivial sentences, their voices trembled at
      the thought of what was about to be said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the little low chair moved a little nearer the great easy-chair;
      their eyes met, their fingers were intertwined, and the two, in low tones,
      slowly called each other by their names.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Desiree!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frantz!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment there was a knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the soft little tap of a daintily gloved hand which fears to soil
      itself by the slightest touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; said Desiree, with a slight gesture of impatience; and Sidonie
      appeared, lovely, coquettish, and affable. She had come to see her little
      Zizi, to embrace her as she was passing by. She had been meaning to come
      for so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frantz&rsquo;s presence seemed to surprise her greatly, and, being engrossed by
      her delight in talking with her former friend, she hardly looked at him.
      After the effusive greetings and caresses, after a pleasant chat over old
      times, she expressed a wish to see the window on the landing and the room
      formerly occupied by the Rislers. It pleased her thus to live all her
      youth over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember, Frantz, when the Princess Hummingbird entered your room,
      holding her little head very straight under a diadem of birds&rsquo; feathers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frantz did not reply. He was too deeply moved to reply. Something warned
      him that it was on his account, solely on his account, that the woman had
      come, that she was determined to see him again, to prevent him from giving
      himself to another, and the poor wretch realized with dismay that she
      would not have to exert herself overmuch to accomplish her object. When he
      saw her enter the room, his whole heart had been caught in her net once
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Desiree suspected nothing, not she! Sidonie&rsquo;s manner was so frank and
      friendly. And then, they were brother and sister now. Love was no longer
      possible between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the little cripple had a vague presentiment of woe when Sidonie,
      standing in the doorway and ready to go, turned carelessly to her
      brother-in-law and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, Frantz, Risler told me to be sure to bring you back to dine
      with us to-night. The carriage is below. We will pick him up as we pass
      the factory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she added, with the prettiest smile imaginable:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will let us have him, won&rsquo;t you, Ziree? Don&rsquo;t be afraid; we will send
      him back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he had the courage to go, the ungrateful wretch!
    </p>
    <p>
      He went without hesitation, without once turning back, whirled away by his
      passion as by a raging sea, and neither on that day nor the next nor ever
      after could Mam&rsquo;zelle Zizi&rsquo;s great easy-chair learn what the interesting
      communication was that the little low chair had to make to it.

      CHAPTER XVI. THE WAITING-ROOM
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Well, yes, I love you, I love you, more than ever and for ever!
   What is the use of struggling and fighting against fate? Our sin
   is stronger than we. But, after all, is it a crime for us to love?
   We were destined for each other. Have we not the right to come
   together, although life has parted us? So, come! It is all over;
   we will go away. Meet me to-morrow evening, Lyon station, at ten
   o&rsquo;clock. The tickets are secured and I shall be there awaiting you.

                         &ldquo;FRANTZ.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      For a month past Sidonie had been hoping for that letter, a month during
      which she had brought all her coaxing and cunning into play to lure her
      brother-in-law on to that written revelation of passion. She had
      difficulty in accomplishing it. It was no easy matter to pervert an honest
      young heart like Frantz&rsquo;s to the point of committing a crime; and in that
      strange contest, in which the one who really loved fought against his own
      cause, she had often felt that she was at the end of her strength and was
      almost discouraged. When she was most confident that he was conquered, his
      sense of right would suddenly rebel, and he would be all ready to flee, to
      escape her once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a triumph it was for her, therefore, when that letter was handed to
      her one morning. Madame Dobson happened to be there. She had just arrived,
      laden with complaints from Georges, who was horribly bored away from his
      mistress, and was beginning to be alarmed concerning this brother-in-law,
      who was more attentive, more jealous, more exacting than a husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! the poor, dear fellow, the poor, dear, fellow,&rdquo; said the sentimental
      American, &ldquo;if you could see how unhappy he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, shaking her curls, she unrolled her music-roll and took from it the
      poor, dear fellow&rsquo;s letters, which she had carefully hidden between the
      leaves of her songs, delighted to be involved in this love-story, to give
      vent to her emotion in an atmosphere of intrigue and mystery which melted
      her cold eyes and suffused her dry, pale complexion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange to say, while lending her aid most willingly to this constant
      going and coming of love-letters, the youthful and attractive Dobson had
      never written or received a single one on her own account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always on the road between Asnieres and Paris with an amorous message
      under her wing, that odd carrier-pigeon remained true to her own dovecot
      and cooed for none but unselfish motives.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Sidonie showed her Frantz&rsquo;s note, Madame Dobson asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall you write in reply?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already written. I consented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! You will go away with that madman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sidonie laughed scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! well, hardly! I consented so that he may go and wait for me at
      the station. That is all. The least I can do is to give him a quarter of
      an hour of agony. He has made me miserable enough for the last month. Just
      consider that I have changed my whole life for my gentleman! I have had to
      close my doors and give up seeing my friends and everybody I know who is
      young and agreeable, beginning with Georges and ending with you. For you
      know, my dear, you weren&rsquo;t agreeable to him, and he would have liked to
      dismiss you with the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The one thing that Sidonie did not mention&mdash;and it was the deepest
      cause of her anger against Frantz&mdash;was that he had frightened her
      terribly by threatening to tell her husband her guilty secret. From that
      moment she had felt decidedly ill at ease, and her life, her dear life,
      which she so petted and coddled, had seemed to her to be exposed to
      serious danger. Yes, the thought that her husband might some day be
      apprized of her conduct positively terrified her.
    </p>
    <p>
      That blessed letter put an end to all her fears. It was impossible now for
      Frantz to expose her, even in the frenzy of his disappointment, knowing
      that she had such a weapon in her hands; and if he did speak, she would
      show the letter, and all his accusations would become in Risler&rsquo;s eyes
      calumny pure and simple. Ah, master judge, we have you now!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am born again&mdash;I am born again!&rdquo; she cried to Madame Dobson. She
      ran out into the garden, gathered great bouquets for her salon, threw the
      windows wide open to the sunlight, gave orders to the cook, the coachman,
      the gardener. The house must be made to look beautiful, for Georges was
      coming back, and for a beginning she organized a grand dinner-party for
      the end of the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next evening Sidonie, Risler, and Madame Dobson were together in the
      salon. While honest Risler turned the leaves of an old handbook of
      mechanics, Sidonie sang to Madame Dobson&rsquo;s accompaniment. Suddenly she
      stopped in the middle of her aria and burst into a peal of laughter. The
      clock had just struck ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler looked up quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing-an idea that came into my head,&rdquo; replied Sidonie, winking of
      Madame Dobson and pointing at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the hour appointed for the meeting, and she was thinking of her
      lover&rsquo;s torture as he waited for her to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the return of the messenger bringing from Sidonie the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; he had
      so feverishly awaited, a great calm had come over his troubled mind, like
      the sudden removal of a heavy burden. No more uncertainty, no more
      clashing between passion and duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not once did it occur to him that on the other side of the landing some
      one was weeping and sighing because of him. Not once did he think of his
      brother&rsquo;s despair, of the ghastly drama they were to leave behind them. He
      saw a sweet little pale face resting beside his in the railway train, a
      blooming lip within reach of his lip, and two fathomless eyes looking at
      him by the soft light of the lamp, to the soothing accompaniment of the
      wheels and the steam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours before the opening of the gate for the designated train, Frantz
      was already at the Lyon station, that gloomy station which, in the distant
      quarter of Paris in which it is situated, seems like a first halting-place
      in the provinces. He sat down in the darkest corner and remained there
      without stirring, as if dazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instinctively, although the appointed hour was still distant, he looked
      among the people who were hurrying along, calling to one another, to see
      if he could not discern that graceful figure suddenly emerging from the
      crowd and thrusting it aside at every step with the radiance of her
      beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      After many departures and arrivals and shrill whistles, the station
      suddenly became empty, as deserted as a church on weekdays. The time for
      the ten o&rsquo;clock train was drawing near. There was no other train before
      that. Frantz rose. In a quarter of an hour, half an hour at the least, she
      would be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frantz went hither and thither, watching the carriages that arrived. Each
      new arrival made him start. He fancied that he saw her enter, closely
      veiled, hesitating, a little embarrassed. How quickly he would be by her
      side, to comfort her, to protect her!
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour for the departure of the train was approaching. He looked at the
      clock. There was but a quarter of an hour more. It alarmed him; but the
      bell at the wicket, which had now been opened, summoned him. He ran
      thither and took his place in the long line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two first-class for Marseilles,&rdquo; he said. It seemed to him as if that
      were equivalent to taking possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made his way back to his post of observation through the luggage-laden
      wagons and the late-comers who jostled him as they ran. The drivers
      shouted, &ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; He stood there among the wheels of the cabs, under
      the horses&rsquo; feet, with deaf ears and staring eyes. Only five minutes more.
      It was almost impossible for her to arrive in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, there she is, it is certainly she&mdash;a woman in black, slender and
      graceful, accompanied by another shorter woman&mdash;Madame Dobson, no
      doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a second glance undeceived him. It was a young woman who resembled
      her, a woman of fashion like her, with a happy face. A man, also young,
      joined them. It was evidently a wedding-party; the mother accompanied
      them, to see them safely on board the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there is the confusion of departure, the last stroke of the bell, the
      steam escaping with a hissing sound, mingled with the hurried footsteps of
      belated passengers, the slamming of doors and the rumbling of the heavy
      omnibuses. Sidonie comes not. And Frantz still waits.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment a hand is placed on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great God!
    </p>
    <p>
      He turns. The coarse face of M. Gardinois, surrounded by a travelling-cap
      with ear-pieces, is before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not mistaken, it is Monsieur Risler. Are you going to Marseilles by
      the express? I am not going far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He explains to Frantz that he has missed the Orleans train, and is going
      to try to connect with Savigny by the Lyon line; then he talks about
      Risler Aine and the factory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems that business hasn&rsquo;t been prospering for some time. They were
      caught in the Bonnardel failure. Ah! our young men need to be careful. At
      the rate they&rsquo;re sailing their ship, the same thing is likely to happen to
      them that happened to Bonnardel. But excuse me, I believe they&rsquo;re about to
      close the gate. Au revoir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frantz has hardly heard what he has been saying. His brother&rsquo;s ruin, the
      destruction of the whole world, nothing is of any further consequence to
      him. He is waiting, waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now the gate is abruptly closed like a last barrier between him and
      his persistent hope. Once more the station is empty. The uproar has been
      transferred to the line of the railway, and suddenly a shrill whistle
      falls upon the lover&rsquo;s ear like an ironical farewell, then dies away in
      the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ten o&rsquo;clock train has gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      He tries to be calm and to reason. Evidently she missed the train from
      Asmeres; but, knowing that he is waiting for her, she will come, no matter
      how late it may be. He will wait longer. The waiting-room was made for
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unhappy man sits down on a bench. The prospect of a long vigil brings
      to his mind a well-known room in which at that hour the lamp burns low on
      a table laden with humming-birds and insects, but that vision passes
      swiftly through his mind in the chaos of confused thoughts to which the
      delirium of suspense gives birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while he thus lost himself in thought, the hours passed. The roofs of
      the buildings of Mazas, buried in darkness, were already beginning to
      stand out distinctly against the brightening sky. What was he to do? He
      must go to Asnieres at once and try to find out what had happened. He
      wished he were there already.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having made up his mind, he descended the steps of the station at a rapid
      pace, passing soldiers with their knapsacks on their backs, and poor
      people who rise early coming to take the morning train, the train of
      poverty and want.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of one of the stations he saw a crowd collected, rag-pickers and
      countrywomen. Doubtless some drama of the night about to reach its
      denouement before the Commissioner of Police. Ah! if Frantz had known what
      that drama was! but he could have no suspicion, and he glanced at the
      crowd indifferently from a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached Asnieres, after a walk of two or three hours, it was like
      an awakening. The sun, rising in all its glory, set field and river on
      fire. The bridge, the houses, the quay, all stood forth with that
      matutinal sharpness of outline which gives the impression of a new day
      emerging, luminous and smiling, from the dense mists of the night. From a
      distance he descried his brother&rsquo;s house, already awake, the open blinds
      and the flowers on the window-sills. He wandered about some time before he
      could summon courage to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly some one hailed him from the shore:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Monsieur Frantz. How early you are today!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Sidonie&rsquo;s coachman taking his horses to bathe in the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has anything happened at the house?&rdquo; inquired Frantz tremblingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Monsieur Frantz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is my brother at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Monsieur slept at the factory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Monsieur Frantz, no one, so far as I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Frantz made up his mind to ring at the small gate. The gardener
      was raking the paths. The house was astir; and, early as it was, he heard
      Sidonie&rsquo;s voice as clear and vibrating as the song of a bird among the
      rose-bushes of the facade.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was talking with animation. Frantz, deeply moved, drew near to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no cream. The &lsquo;cafe parfait&rsquo; will be enough. Be sure that it&rsquo;s well
      frozen and ready at seven o&rsquo;clock. Oh! about an entree&mdash;let us see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was holding council with her cook concerning the famous dinner-party
      for the next day. Her brother-in-law&rsquo;s sudden appearance did not
      disconcert her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! good-morning, Frantz,&rdquo; she said very coolly. &ldquo;I am at your service
      directly. We&rsquo;re to have some people to dinner to-morrow, customers of the
      firm, a grand business dinner. You&rsquo;ll excuse me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fresh and smiling, in the white ruffles of her trailing morning-gown and
      her little lace cap, she continued to discuss her menu, inhaling the cool
      air that rose from the fields and the river. There was not the slightest
      trace of chagrin or anxiety upon that tranquil face, which was a striking
      contrast to the lover&rsquo;s features, distorted by a night of agony and
      fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long quarter of an hour Frantz, sitting in a corner of the salon,
      saw all the conventional dishes of a bourgeois dinner pass before him in
      their regular order, from the little hot pates, the sole Normande and the
      innumerable ingredients of which that dish is composed, to the Montreuil
      peaches and Fontainebleau grapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, when they were alone and he was able to speak, he asked in a
      hollow voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you receive my letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had risen to go to the mirror and adjust a little curl or two
      entangled with her floating ribbons, and continued, looking at herself all
      the while:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I received your letter. Indeed, I was charmed to receive it. Now,
      should you ever feel inclined to tell your brother any of the vile stories
      about me that you have threatened me with, I could easily satisfy him that
      the only source of your lying tale-bearing was anger with me for repulsing
      a criminal passion as it deserved. Consider yourself warned, my dear boy&mdash;and
      au revoir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As pleased as an actress who has just delivered a telling speech with fine
      effect, she passed him and left the room smiling, with a little curl at
      the corners of her mouth, triumphant and without anger. And he did not
      kill her!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. AN ITEM OF NEWS
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the evening preceding that ill-omened day, a few moments after Frantz
      had stealthily left his room on Rue de Braque, the illustrious Delobelle
      returned home, with downcast face and that air of lassitude and
      disillusionment with which he always met untoward events.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! mon Dieu, my poor man, what has happened?&rdquo; instantly inquired Madame
      Delobelle, whom twenty years of exaggerated dramatic pantomime had not yet
      surfeited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before replying, the ex-actor, who never failed to precede his most
      trivial words with some facial play, learned long before for stage
      purposes, dropped his lower lip, in token of disgust and loathing, as if
      he had just swallowed something very bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter is that those Rislers are certainly ingrates or egotists, and,
      beyond all question, exceedingly ill-bred. Do you know what I just learned
      downstairs from the concierge, who glanced at me out of the corner of his
      eye, making sport of me? Well, Frantz Risler has gone! He left the house a
      short time ago, and has left Paris perhaps ere this, without so much as
      coming to shake my hand, to thank me for the welcome he has received here.
      What do you think of that? For he didn&rsquo;t say good-by to you two either,
      did he? And yet, only a month ago, he was always in our rooms, without any
      remonstrance from us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mamma Delobelle uttered an exclamation of genuine surprise and grief.
      Desiree, on the contrary, did not say a word or make a motion. She was
      always the same little iceberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! wretched mother, turn your eyes upon your daughter. See that
      transparent pallor, those tearless eyes which gleam unwaveringly, as if
      their thoughts and their gaze were concentrated on some object visible to
      them alone. Cause that poor suffering heart to open itself to you.
      Question your child. Make her speak, above all things make her weep, to
      rid her of the burden that is stifling her, so that her tear-dimmed eyes
      can no longer distinguish in space that horrible unknown thing upon which
      they are fixed in desperation now.
    </p>
    <p>
      For nearly a month past, ever since the day when Sidonie came and took
      Frantz away in her coupe, Desiree had known that she was no longer loved,
      and she knew her rival&rsquo;s name. She bore them no ill-will, she pitied them
      rather. But, why had he returned? Why had he so heedlessly given her false
      hopes? How many tears had she devoured in silence since those hours! How
      many tales of woe had she told her little birds! For once more it was work
      that had sustained her, desperate, incessant work, which, by its
      regularity and monotony, by the constant recurrence of the same duties and
      the same motions, served as a balance-wheel to her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lately Frantz was not altogether lost to her. Although he came but rarely
      to see her, she knew that he was there, she could hear him go in and out,
      pace, the floor with restless step, and sometimes, through the half-open
      door, see his loved shadow hurry across the landing. He did not seem
      happy. Indeed, what happiness could be in store for him? He loved his
      brother&rsquo;s wife. And at the thought that Frantz was not happy, the fond
      creature almost forgot her own sorrow to think only of the sorrow of the
      man she loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was well aware that it was impossible that he could ever love her
      again. But she thought that perhaps she would see him come in some day,
      wounded and dying, that he would sit down on the little low chair, lay his
      head on her knees, and with a great sob tell her of his suffering and say
      to her, &ldquo;Comfort me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That forlorn hope kept her alive for three weeks. She needed so little as
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no. Even that was denied her. Frantz had gone, gone without a glance
      for her, without a parting word. The lover&rsquo;s desertion was followed by the
      desertion of the friend. It was horrible!
    </p>
    <p>
      At her father&rsquo;s first words, she felt as if she were hurled into a deep,
      ice-cold abyss, filled with darkness, into which she plunged swiftly,
      helplessly, well knowing that she would never return to the light. She was
      suffocating. She would have liked to resist, to struggle, to call for
      help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who was there who had the power to sustain her in that great disaster?
    </p>
    <p>
      God? The thing that is called Heaven?
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not even think of that. In Paris, especially in the quarters where
      the working class live, the houses are too high, the streets too narrow,
      the air too murky for heaven to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Death alone at which the little cripple was gazing so earnestly.
      Her course was determined upon at once: she must die. But how?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting motionless in her easy-chair, she considered what manner of death
      she should choose. As she was almost never alone, she could not think of
      the brazier of charcoal, to be lighted after closing the doors and
      windows. As she never went out she could not think either of poison to be
      purchased at the druggist&rsquo;s, a little package of white powder to be buried
      in the depths of the pocket, with the needle-case and the thimble. There
      was the phosphorus on the matches, too, the verdigris on old sous, the
      open window with the paved street below; but the thought of forcing upon
      her parents the ghastly spectacle of a self-inflicted death-agony, the
      thought that what would remain of her, picked up amid a crowd of people,
      would be so frightful to look upon, made her reject that method.
    </p>
    <p>
      She still had the river. At all events, the water carries you away
      somewhere, so that nobody finds you and your death is shrouded in mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The river! She shuddered at the mere thought. But it was not the vision of
      the deep, black water that terrified her. The girls of Paris laugh at
      that. You throw your apron over your head so that you can&rsquo;t see, and pouf!
      But she must go downstairs, into the street, all alone, and the street
      frightened her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was a terrible thing to go out into the street alone. She must
      wait until the gas was out, steal softly downstairs when her mother had
      gone to bed, pull the cord of the gate, and make her way across Paris,
      where you meet men who stare impertinently into your face, and pass
      brilliantly lighted cafes. The river was a long distance away. She would
      be very tired. However, there was no other way than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to bed, my child; are you going to sit up any longer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With her eyes on her work, &ldquo;my child&rdquo; replied that she was. She wished to
      finish her dozen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, then,&rdquo; said Mamma Delobelle, her enfeebled sight being unable
      to endure the light longer. &ldquo;I have put father&rsquo;s supper by the fire. Just
      look at it before you go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Desire did not lie. She really intended to finish her dozen, so that her
      father could take them to the shop in the morning; and really, to see that
      tranquil little head bending forward in the white light of the lamp, one
      would never have imagined all the sinister thoughts with which it was
      thronged.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she takes up the last bird of the dozen, a marvellously lovely
      little bird whose wings seem to have been dipped in sea-water, all green
      as they are with a tinge of sapphire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carefully, daintily, Desiree suspends it on a piece of brass wire, in the
      charming attitude of a frightened creature about to fly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! how true it is that the little blue bird is about to fly away! What a
      desperate flight into space! How certain one feels that this time it is
      the great journey, the everlasting journey from which there is no return!
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by, very softly, Desiree opens the wardrobe and takes a thin shawl
      which she throws over her shoulders; then she goes. What? Not a glance at
      her mother, not a silent farewell, not a tear? No, nothing! With the
      terrible clearness of vision of those who are about to die, she suddenly
      realizes that her childhood and youth have been sacrificed to a vast
      self-love. She feels very sure that a word from their great man will
      comfort that sleeping mother, with whom she is almost angry for not
      waking, for allowing her to go without a quiver of her closed eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      When one dies young, even by one&rsquo;s own act, it is never without a
      rebellious feeling, and poor Desiree bids adieu to life, indignant with
      destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she is in the street. Where is she going? Everything seems deserted
      already. Desiree walks rapidly, wrapped in her little shawl, head erect,
      dry-eyed. Not knowing the way, she walks straight ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dark, narrow streets of the Marais, where gas-jets twinkle at long
      intervals, cross and recross and wind about, and again and again in her
      feverish course she goes over the same ground. There is always something
      between her and the river. And to think that, at that very hour, almost in
      the same quarter, some one else is wandering through the streets, waiting,
      watching, desperate! Ah! if they could but meet. Suppose she should accost
      that feverish watcher, should ask him to direct her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Monsieur. How can I get to the Seine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would recognize her at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Can it be you, Mam&rsquo;zelle Zizi? What are you doing out-of-doors at
      this time of night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to die, Frantz. You have taken away all my pleasure in
      living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon he, deeply moved, would seize her, press her to his heart and
      carry her away in his arms, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, do not die. I need you to comfort me, to cure all the wounds the
      other has inflicted on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But that is a mere poet&rsquo;s dream, one of the meetings that life can not
      bring about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Streets, more streets, then a square and a bridge whose lanterns make
      another luminous bridge in the black water. Here is the river at last. The
      mist of that damp, soft autumn evening causes all of this huge Paris,
      entirely strange to her as it is, to appear to her like an enormous
      confused mass, which her ignorance of the landmarks magnifies still more.
      This is the place where she must die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor little Desiree!
    </p>
    <p>
      She recalls the country excursion which Frantz had organized for her. That
      breath of nature, which she breathed that day for the first time, falls to
      her lot again at the moment of her death. &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; it seems to say to
      her; and she replies mentally, &ldquo;Oh! yes, I remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She remembers only too well. When it arrives at the end of the quay, which
      was bedecked as for a holiday, the furtive little shadow pauses at the
      steps leading down to the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost immediately there are shouts and excitement all along the quay:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick&mdash;a boat&mdash;grappling-irons!&rdquo; Boatmen and policemen come
      running from all sides. A boat puts off from the shore with a lantern in
      the bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flower-women awake, and, when one of them asks with a yawn what is
      happening, the woman who keeps the cafe that crouches at the corner of the
      bridge answers coolly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman just jumped into the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But no. The river has refused to take that child. It has been moved to
      pity by so great gentleness and charm. In the light of the lanterns
      swinging to and fro on the shore, a black group forms and moves away. She
      is saved! It was a sand-hauler who fished her out. Policemen are carrying
      her, surrounded by boatmen and lightermen, and in the darkness a hoarse
      voice is heard saying with a sneer: &ldquo;That water-hen gave me a lot of
      trouble. You ought to see how she slipped through my fingers! I believe
      she wanted to make me lose my reward.&rdquo; Gradually the tumult subsides, the
      bystanders disperse, and the black group moves away toward a
      police-station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! poor girl, you thought that it was an easy matter to have done with
      life, to disappear abruptly. You did not know that, instead of bearing you
      away swiftly to the oblivion you sought, the river would drive you back to
      all the shame, to all the ignominy of unsuccessful suicide. First of all,
      the station, the hideous station, with its filthy benches, its floor where
      the sodden dust seems like mud from the street. There Desiree was doomed
      to pass the rest of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last day broke with the shuddering glare so distressing to invalids.
      Suddenly aroused from her torpor, Desiree sat up in her bed, threw off the
      blanket in which they had wrapped her, and despite fatigue and fever tried
      to stand, in order to regain full possession of her faculties and her
      will. She had but one thought&mdash;to escape from all those eyes that
      were opening on all sides, to leave that frightful place where the breath
      of sleep was so heavy and its attitudes so distorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I implore you, messieurs,&rdquo; she said, trembling from head to foot, &ldquo;let me
      return to mamma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardened as they were to Parisian dramas, even those good people realized
      that they were face to face with something more worthy of attention, more
      affecting than usual. But they could not take her back to her mother as
      yet. She must go before the commissioner first. That was absolutely
      necessary. They called a cab from compassion for her; but she must go from
      the station to the cab, and there was a crowd at the door to stare at the
      little lame girl with the damp hair glued to her temples, and her
      policeman&rsquo;s blanket which did not prevent her shivering. At headquarters
      she was conducted up a dark, damp stairway where sinister figures were
      passing to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Desiree entered the room, a man rose from the shadow and came to meet
      her, holding out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the man of the reward, her hideous rescuer at twenty-five francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, little-mother,&rdquo; he said, with his cynical laugh, and in a voice
      that made one think of foggy nights on the water, &ldquo;how are we since our
      dive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unhappy girl was burning red with fever and shame; so bewildered that
      it seemed to her as if the river had left a veil over her eyes, a buzzing
      in her ears. At last she was ushered into a smaller room, into the
      presence of a pompous individual, wearing the insignia of the Legion of
      Honor, Monsieur le Commissaire in person, who was sipping his &lsquo;cafe au
      lait&rsquo; and reading the &lsquo;Gazette des Tribunaux.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it&rsquo;s you, is it?&rdquo; he said in a surly tone and without raising his
      eyes from his paper, as he dipped a piece of bread in his cup; and the
      officer who had brought Desiree began at once to read his report:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At quarter to twelve, on Quai de la Megisserie, in front of No. 17, the
      woman Delobelle, twenty-four years old, flower-maker, living with her
      parents on Rue de Braque, tried to commit suicide by throwing herself into
      the Seine, and was taken out safe and sound by Sieur Parcheminet,
      sand-hauler of Rue de la Butte-Chaumont.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur le Commissaire listened as he ate, with the listless, bored
      expression of a man whom nothing can surprise; at the end he gazed sternly
      and with a pompous affectation of virtue at the woman Delobelle, and
      lectured her in the most approved fashion. It was very wicked, it was
      cowardly, this thing that she had done. What could have driven her to such
      an evil act? Why did she seek to destroy herself? Come, woman Delobelle,
      answer, why was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      But the woman Delobelle obstinately declined to answer. It seemed to her
      that it would put a stigma upon her love to avow it in such a place. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she whispered, shivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Testy and impatient, the commissioner decided that she should be taken
      back to her parents, but only on one condition: she must promise never to
      try it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, do you promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, Monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never try again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no, indeed I will not, never&mdash;never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding her protestations, Monsieur le Commissaire de Police shook
      his head, as if he did not trust her oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she is outside once more, on the way to her home, to a place of
      refuge; but her martyrdom was not yet at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the carriage, the officer who accompanied her was too polite, too
      affable. She seemed not to understand, shrank from him, withdrew her hand.
      What torture! But the most terrible moment of all was the arrival in Rue
      de Braque, where the whole house was in a state of commotion, and the
      inquisitive curiosity of the neighbors must be endured. Early in the
      morning the whole quarter had been informed of her disappearance. It was
      rumored that she had gone away with Frantz Risler. The illustrious
      Delobelle had gone forth very early, intensely agitated, with his hat awry
      and rumpled wristbands, a sure indication of extraordinary preoccupation;
      and the concierge, on taking up the provisions, had found the poor mother
      half mad, running from one room to another, looking for a note from the
      child, for any clew, however unimportant, that would enable her at least
      to form some conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a carriage stopped in front of the door. Voices and footsteps
      echoed through the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M&rsquo;ame Delobelle, here she is! Your daughter&rsquo;s been found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was really Desiree who came toiling up the stairs on the arm of a
      stranger, pale and fainting, without hat or shawl, and wrapped in a great
      brown cape. When she saw her mother she smiled at her with an almost
      foolish expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be alarmed, it is nothing,&rdquo; she tried to say, then sank to the
      floor. Mamma Delobelle would never have believed that she was so strong.
      To lift her daughter, take her into the room, and put her to bed was a
      matter of a moment; and she talked to her and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are at last. Where have you come from, you bad child? Tell me,
      is it true that you tried to kill yourself? Were you suffering so
      terribly? Why did you conceal it from me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she saw her mother in that condition, with tear-stained face, aged in
      a few short hours, Desiree felt a terrible burden of remorse. She
      remembered that she had gone away without saying good-by to her, and that
      in the depths of her heart she had accused her of not loving her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not loving her!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it would kill me if you should die,&rdquo; said the poor mother. &ldquo;Oh! when
      I got up this morning and saw that your bed hadn&rsquo;t been slept in and that
      you weren&rsquo;t in the workroom either!&mdash;I just turned round and fell
      flat. Are you warm now? Do you feel well? You won&rsquo;t do it again, will you&mdash;try
      to kill yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she tucked in the bed-clothes, rubbed her feet, and rocked her upon
      her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she lay in bed with her eyes closed, Desiree saw anew all the incidents
      of her suicide, all the hideous scenes through which she had passed in
      returning from death to life. In the fever, which rapidly increased, in
      the intense drowsiness which began to overpower her, her mad journey
      across Paris continued to excite and torment her. Myriads of dark streets
      stretched away before her, with the Seine at the end of each.
    </p>
    <p>
      That ghastly river, which she could not find in the night, haunted her
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt that she was besmirched with its slime, its mud; and in the
      nightmare that oppressed her, the poor child, powerless to escape the
      obsession of her recollections, whispered to her mother: &ldquo;Hide me&mdash;hide
      me&mdash;I am ashamed!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. SHE PROMISED NOT TO TRY AGAIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Oh! no, she will not try it again. Monsieur le Commissaire need have no
      fear. In the first place how could she go as far as the river, now that
      she can not stir from her bed? If Monsieur le Commissaire could see her
      now, he would not doubt her word. Doubtless the wish, the longing for
      death, so unmistakably written on her pale face the other morning, are
      still visible there; but they are softened, resigned. The woman Delobelle
      knows that by waiting a little, yes, a very little time, she will have
      nothing more to wish for.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctors declare that she is dying of pneumonia; she must have
      contracted it in her wet clothes. The doctors are mistaken; it is not
      pneumonia. Is it her love, then, that is killing her? No. Since that
      terrible night she no longer thinks of Frantz, she no longer feels that
      she is worthy to love or to be loved. Thenceforth there is a stain upon
      her spotless life, and it is of the shame of that and of nothing else that
      she is dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mamma Delobelle sits by Desiree&rsquo;s bed, working by the light from the
      window, and nursing her daughter. From time to time she raises her eyes to
      contemplate that mute despair, that mysterious disease, then hastily
      resumes her work; for it is one of the hardest trials of the poor that
      they can not suffer at their ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mamma Delobelle had to work alone now, and her fingers had not the
      marvellous dexterity of Desiree&rsquo;s little hands; medicines were dear, and
      she would not for anything in the world have interfered with one of &ldquo;the
      father&rsquo;s&rdquo; cherished habits. And so, at whatever hour the invalid opened
      her eyes, she would see her mother, in the pale light of early morning, or
      under her night lamp, working, working without rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between two stitches the mother would look up at her child, whose face
      grew paler and paler:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; the sick girl would reply, with a faint, heartbroken smile,
      which illumined her sorrowful face and showed all the ravages that had
      been wrought upon it, as a sunbeam, stealing into a poor man&rsquo;s lodging,
      instead of brightening it, brings out more clearly its cheerlessness and
      nudity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The illustrious Delobelle was never there. He had not changed in any
      respect the habits of a strolling player out of an engagement. And yet he
      knew that his daughter was dying: the doctor had told him so. Moreover, it
      had been a terrible blow to him, for, at heart, he loved his child dearly;
      but in that singular nature the most sincere and the most genuine feelings
      adopted a false and unnatural mode of expression, by the same law which
      ordains that, when a shelf is placed awry, nothing that you place upon it
      seems to stand straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delobelle&rsquo;s natural tendency was, before everything, to air his grief, to
      spread it abroad. He played the role of the unhappy father from one end of
      the boulevard to the other. He was always to be found in the neighborhood
      of the theatres or at the actors&rsquo; restaurant, with red eyes and pale
      cheeks. He loved to invite the question, &ldquo;Well, my poor old fellow, how
      are things going at home?&rdquo; Thereupon he would shake his head with a
      nervous gesture; his grimace held tears in check, his mouth imprecations,
      and he would stab heaven with a silent glance, overflowing with wrath, as
      when he played the &lsquo;Medecin des Enfants;&rsquo; all of which did not prevent
      him, however, from bestowing the most delicate and thoughtful attentions
      upon his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also maintained an unalterable confidence in himself, no matter what
      happened. And yet his eyes came very near being opened to the truth at
      last. A hot little hand laid upon that pompous, illusion-ridden head came
      very near expelling the bee that had been buzzing there so long. This is
      how it came to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night Desiree awoke with a start, in a very strange state. It should
      be said that the doctor, when he came to see her on the preceding evening,
      had been greatly surprised to find her suddenly brighter and calmer, and
      entirely free from fever. Without attempting to explain this unhoped-for
      resurrection, he had gone away, saying, &ldquo;Let us wait and see&rdquo;; he relied
      upon the power of youth to throw off disease, upon the resistless force of
      the life-giving sap, which often engrafts a new life upon the very
      symptoms of death. If he had looked under Desiree&rsquo;s pillow, he would have
      found there a letter postmarked Cairo, wherein lay the secret of that
      happy change. Four pages signed by Frantz, his whole conduct confessed and
      explained to his dear little Zizi.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the very letter of which the sick girl had dreamed. If she had
      dictated it herself, all the phrases likely to touch her heart, all the
      delicately worded excuses likely to pour balm into her wounds, would have
      been less satisfactorily expressed. Frantz repented, asked forgiveness,
      and without making any promises, above all without asking anything from
      her, described to his faithful friend his struggles, his remorse, his
      sufferings.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a misfortune that that letter had not arrived a few days earlier.
      Now, all those kind words were to Desiree like the dainty dishes that are
      brought too late to a man dying of hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she awoke, and, as we said a moment since, in an extraordinary
      state.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her head, which seemed to her lighter than usual, there suddenly began
      a grand procession of thoughts and memories. The most distant periods of
      her past seemed to approach her. The most trivial incidents of her
      childhood, scenes that she had not then understood, words heard as in a
      dream, recurred to her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      From her bed she could see her father and mother, one by her side, the
      other in the workroom, the door of which had been left open. Mamma
      Delobelle was lying back in her chair in the careless attitude of
      long-continued fatigue, heeded at last; and all the scars, the ugly sabre
      cuts with which age and suffering brand the faces of the old, manifested
      themselves, ineffaceable and pitiful to see, in the relaxation of slumber.
      Desiree would have liked to be strong enough to rise and kiss that lovely,
      placid brow, furrowed by wrinkles which did not mar its beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      In striking contrast to that picture, the illustrious Delobelle appeared
      to his daughter through the open door in one of his favorite attitudes.
      Seated before the little white cloth that bore his supper, with his body
      at an angle of sixty-seven and a half degrees, he was eating and at the
      same time running through a pamphlet which rested against the carafe in
      front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in her life Desiree noticed the striking lack of
      harmony between her emaciated mother, scantily clad in little black
      dresses which made her look even thinner and more haggard than she really
      was, and her happy, well-fed, idle, placid, thoughtless father. At a
      glance she realized the difference between the two lives. What would
      become of them when she was no longer there? Either her mother would work
      too hard and would kill herself; or else the poor woman would be obliged
      to cease working altogether, and that selfish husband, forever engrossed
      by his theatrical ambition, would allow them both to drift gradually into
      abject poverty, that black hole which widens and deepens as one goes down
      into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose that, before going away&mdash;something told her that she would go
      very soon&mdash;before going away, she should tear away the thick bandage
      that the poor man kept over his eyes wilfully and by force?
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a hand as light and loving as hers could attempt that operation. Only
      she had the right to say to her father:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Earn your living. Give up the stage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, as time was flying, Desire Delobelle summoned all her courage
      and called softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa-papa&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At his daughter&rsquo;s first summons the great man hurried to her side. He
      entered Desiree&rsquo;s bedroom, radiant and superb, very erect, his lamp in his
      hand and a camellia in his buttonhole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, Zizi. Aren&rsquo;t you asleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice had a joyous intonation that produced a strange effect amid the
      prevailing gloom. Desiree motioned to him not to speak, pointing to her
      sleeping mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put down your lamp&mdash;I have something to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice, broken by emotion, impressed him; and so did her eyes, for they
      seemed larger than usual, and were lighted by a piercing glance that he
      had never seen in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He approached with something like awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter, Bichette? Do you feel any worse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Desiree replied with a movement of her little pale face that she felt very
      ill and that she wanted to speak to him very close, very close. When the
      great man stood by her pillow, she laid her burning hand on the great
      man&rsquo;s arm and whispered in his ear. She was very ill, hopelessly ill. She
      realized fully that she had not long to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, father, you will be left alone with mamma. Don&rsquo;t tremble like that.
      You knew that this thing must come, yes, that it was very near. But I want
      to tell you this. When I am gone, I am terribly afraid mamma won&rsquo;t be
      strong enough to support the family just see how pale and exhausted she
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The actor looked at his &ldquo;sainted wife,&rdquo; and seemed greatly surprised to
      find that she did really look so badly. Then he consoled himself with the
      selfish remark:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She never was very strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That remark and the tone in which it was made angered Desiree and
      strengthened her determination. She continued, without pity for the
      actor&rsquo;s illusions:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will become of you two when I am no longer here? Oh! I know that you
      have great hopes, but it takes them a long while to come to anything. The
      results you have waited for so long may not arrive for a long time to
      come; and until then what will you do? Listen! my dear father, I would not
      willingly hurt you; but it seems to me that at your age, as intelligent as
      you are, it would be easy for you&mdash;I am sure Monsieur Risler Aine
      would ask nothing better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke slowly, with an effort, carefully choosing her words, leaving
      long pauses between every two sentences, hoping always that they might be
      filled by a movement, an exclamation from her father. But the actor did
      not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that you would do well,&rdquo; pursued Desiree, timidly, &ldquo;I think that
      you would do well to give up&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&mdash;what?&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused when she saw the effect of her words. The old actor&rsquo;s mobile
      features were suddenly contracted under the lash of violent despair; and
      tears, genuine tears which he did not even think of concealing behind his
      hand as they do on the stage, filled his eyes but did not flow, so tightly
      did his agony clutch him by the throat. The poor devil began to
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She murmured twice or thrice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To give up&mdash;to give up&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then her little head fell back upon the pillow, and she died without
      having dared to tell him what he would do well to give up.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. APPROACHING CLOUDS
    </h2>
    <p>
      One night, near the end of January, old Sigismond Planus, cashier of the
      house of Fromont Jeune and Risler Aine, was awakened with a start in his
      little house at Montrouge by the same teasing voice, the same rattling of
      chains, followed by that fatal cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The notes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; thought the worthy man, sitting up in bed; &ldquo;day after
      to-morrow will be the last day of the month. And I have the courage to
      sleep!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In truth, a considerable sum of money must be raised: a hundred thousand
      francs to be paid on two obligations, and at a moment when, for the first
      time in thirty years, the strong-box of the house of Fromont was
      absolutely empty. What was to be done? Sigismond had tried several times
      to speak to Fromont Jeune, but he seemed to shun the burdensome
      responsibility of business, and when he walked through the offices was
      always in a hurry, feverishly excited, and seemed neither to see nor hear
      anything about him. He answered the old cashier&rsquo;s anxious questions,
      gnawing his moustache:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, all right, my old Planus. Don&rsquo;t disturb yourself; I will look
      into it.&rdquo; And as he said it, he seemed to be thinking of something else,
      to be a thousand leagues away from his surroundings. It was rumored in the
      factory, where his liaison with Madame Risler was no longer a secret to
      anybody, that Sidonie deceived him, made him very unhappy; and, indeed,
      his mistress&rsquo;s whims worried him much more than his cashier&rsquo;s anxiety. As
      for Risler, no one ever saw him; he passed his days shut up in a room
      under the roof, overseeing the mysterious, interminable manufacture of his
      machines.
    </p>
    <p>
      This indifference on the part of the employers to the affairs of the
      factory, this absolute lack of oversight, had led by slow degrees to
      general demoralization. Some business was still done, because an
      established house will go on alone for years by force of the first
      impetus; but what ruin, what chaos beneath that apparent prosperity?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sigismond knew it better than any one, and as if to see his way more
      clearly amid the multitude of painful thoughts which whirled madly through
      his brain, the cashier lighted his candle, sat down on his bed, and
      thought, &ldquo;Where were they to find that hundred thousand francs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the notes back. I have no funds to meet them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, no! That was not possible. Any sort of humiliation was preferable to
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s decided. I will go to-morrow,&rdquo; sighed the poor cashier.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he tossed about in torture, unable to close an eye until morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the late hour, Georges Fromont had not yet retired. He was
      sitting by the fire, with his head in his hands, in the blind and dumb
      concentration due to irreparable misfortune, thinking of Sidonie, of that
      terrible Sidonie who was asleep at that moment on the floor above. She was
      positively driving him mad. She was false to him, he was sure of it,&mdash;she
      was false to him with the Toulousan tenor, that Cazabon, alias Cazaboni,
      whom Madame Dobson had brought to the house. For a long time he had
      implored her not to receive that man; but Sidonie would not listen to him,
      and on that very day, speaking of a grand ball she was about to give, she
      had declared explicitly that nothing should prevent her inviting her
      tenor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s your lover!&rdquo; Georges had exclaimed angrily, his eyes gazing
      into hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not denied it; she had not even turned her eyes away.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to think that he had sacrificed everything to that woman&mdash;his
      fortune, his honor, even his lovely Claire, who lay sleeping with her
      child in the adjoining room&mdash;a whole lifetime of happiness within
      reach of his hand, which he had spurned for that vile creature! Now she
      had admitted that she did not love him, that she loved another. And he,
      the coward, still longed for her. In heaven&rsquo;s name, what potion had she
      given him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Carried away by indignation that made the blood boil in his veins, Georges
      Fromont started from his armchair and strode feverishly up and down the
      room, his footsteps echoing in the silence of the sleeping house like
      living insomnia. The other was asleep upstairs. She could sleep by favor
      of her heedless, remorseless nature. Perhaps, too, she was thinking of her
      Cazaboni.
    </p>
    <p>
      When that thought passed through his mind, Georges had a mad longing to go
      up, to wake Risler, to tell him everything and destroy himself with her.
      Really that deluded husband was too idiotic! Why did he not watch her more
      closely? She was pretty enough, yes, and vicious enough, too, for every
      precaution to be taken with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was while he was struggling amid such cruel and unfruitful
      reflections as these that the devil of anxiety whispered in his ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The notes! the notes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The miserable wretch! In his wrath he had entirely forgotten them. And yet
      he had long watched the approach of that terrible last day of January. How
      many times, between two assignations, when his mind, free for a moment
      from thoughts of Sidonie, recurred to his business, to the realities of
      life-how many times had he said to himself, &ldquo;That day will be the end of
      everything!&rdquo; But, as with all those who live in the delirium of
      intoxication, his cowardice convinced him that it was too late to mend
      matters, and he returned more quickly and more determinedly to his evil
      courses, in order to forget, to divert his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that was no longer possible. He saw the impending disaster clearly, in
      its full meaning; and Sigismond Planus&rsquo;s wrinkled, solemn face rose before
      him with its sharply cut features, whose absence of expression softened
      their harshness, and his light German-Swiss eyes, which had haunted him
      for many weeks with their impassive stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, no, he had not the hundred thousand francs, nor did he know where to
      get them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crisis which, a few hours before, seemed to him a chaos, an eddying
      whirl in which he could see nothing distinctly and whose very confusion
      was a source of hope, appeared to him at that moment with appalling
      distinctness. An empty cash-box, closed doors, notes protested, ruin, are
      the phantoms he saw whichever way he turned. And when, on top of all the
      rest, came the thought of Sidonie&rsquo;s treachery, the wretched, desperate
      man, finding nothing to cling to in that shipwreck, suddenly uttered a
      sob, a cry of agony, as if appealing for help to some higher power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Georges, Georges, it is I. What is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife stood before him, his wife who now waited for him every night,
      watching anxiously for his return from the club, for she still believed
      that he passed his evenings there. That night she had heard him walking
      very late in his room. At last her child fell asleep, and Claire, hearing
      the father sob, ran to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! what boundless, though tardy remorse overwhelmed him when he saw her
      before him, so deeply moved, so lovely and so loving! Yes, she was in very
      truth the true companion, the faithful friend. How could he have deserted
      her? For a long, long time he wept upon her shoulder, unable to speak. And
      it was fortunate that he did not speak, for he would have told her all,
      all. The unhappy man felt the need of pouring out his heart&mdash;an
      irresistible longing to accuse himself, to ask forgiveness, to lessen the
      weight of the remorse that was crushing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spared him the pain of uttering a word:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been gambling, have you not? You have lost&mdash;lost heavily?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved his head affirmatively; then, when he was able to speak, he
      confessed that he must have a hundred thousand francs for the day after
      the morrow, and that he did not know how to obtain them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not reproach him. She was one of those women who, when face to
      face with disaster, think only of repairing it, without a word of
      recrimination. Indeed, in the bottom of her heart she blessed this
      misfortune which brought him nearer to her and became a bond between their
      two lives, which had long lain so far apart. She reflected a moment. Then,
      with an effort indicating a resolution which had cost a bitter struggle,
      she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not all is lost as yet. I will go to Savigny tomorrow and ask my
      grandfather for the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would never have dared to suggest that to her. Indeed, it would never
      have occurred to him. She was so proud and old Gardinois so hard! Surely
      that was a great sacrifice for her to make for him, and a striking proof
      of her love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Claire, Claire&mdash;how good your are!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without replying, she led him to their child&rsquo;s cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss her,&rdquo; she said softly; and as they stood there side by side, their
      heads leaning over the child, Georges was afraid of waking her, and he
      embraced the mother passionately.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. REVELATIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! here&rsquo;s Sigismond. How goes the world, Pere Sigismond? How is
      business? Is it good with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old cashier smiled affably, shook hands with the master, his wife, and
      his brother, and, as they talked, looked curiously about. They were in a
      manufactory of wallpapers on Faubourg Saint-Antoine, the establishment of
      the little Prochassons, who were beginning to be formidable rivals. Those
      former employees of the house of Fromont had set up on their own account,
      beginning in a very, small way, and had gradually succeeded in making for
      themselves a place on &lsquo;Change. Fromont the uncle had assisted them for a
      long while with his credit and his money; the result being most friendly
      relations between the two firms, and a balance&mdash;between ten or
      fifteen thousand francs&mdash;which had never been definitely adjusted,
      because they knew that money was in good hands when the Prochassons had
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, the appearance of the factory was most reassuring. The chimneys
      proudly shook their plumes of smoke. The dull roar of constant toil
      indicated that the workshops were full of workmen and activity. The
      buildings were in good repair, the windows clean; everything had an aspect
      of enthusiasm, of good-humor, of discipline; and behind the grating in the
      counting-room sat the wife of one of the brothers, simply dressed, with
      her hair neatly arranged, and an air of authority on her youthful face,
      deeply intent upon a long column of figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Sigismond thought bitterly of the difference between the house of
      Fromont, once so wealthy, now living entirely upon its former reputation,
      and the ever-increasing prosperity of the establishment before his eyes.
      His stealthy glance penetrated to the darkest corners, seeking some
      defect, something to criticise; and his failure to find anything made his
      heart heavy and his smile forced and anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      What embarrassed him most of all was the question how he should approach
      the subject of the money due his employers without betraying the emptiness
      of the strongbox. The poor man assumed a jaunty, unconcerned air which was
      truly pitiful to see. Business was good&mdash;very good. He happened to be
      passing through the quarter and thought he would come in a moment&mdash;that
      was natural, was it not? One likes to see old friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these preambles, these constantly expanding circumlocutions, did not
      bring him to the point he wished to reach; on the contrary, they led him
      away from his goal, and imagining that he detected surprise in the eyes of
      his auditors, he went completely astray, stammered, lost his head, and, as
      a last resort, took his hat and pretended to go. At the door he suddenly
      bethought himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! by the way, so long as I am here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave a little wink which he thought sly, but which was in reality
      heartrending.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long as I am here, suppose we settle that old account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two brothers and the young woman in the counting-room gazed at one
      another a second, unable to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Account? What account, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then all three began to laugh at the same moment, and heartily too, as if
      at a joke, a rather broad joke, on the part of the old cashier. &ldquo;Go along
      with you, you sly old Pere Planus!&rdquo; The old man laughed with them! He
      laughed without any desire to laugh, simply to do as the others did.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they explained. Fromont Jeune had come in person, six months
      before, to collect the balance in their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sigismond felt that his strength was going. But he summoned courage to
      say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes; true. I had forgotten. Sigismond Planus is growing old, that is
      plain. I am failing, my children, I am failing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the old man went away wiping his eyes, in which still glistened great
      tears caused by the hearty laugh he had just enjoyed. The young people
      behind him exchanged glances and shook their heads. They understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blow he had received was so crushing that the cashier, as soon as he
      was out-of-doors, was obliged to sit down on a bench. So that was the
      reason why Georges did not come to the counting-room for money. He made
      his collections in person. What had taken place at the Prochassons&rsquo; had
      probably been repeated everywhere else. It was quite useless, therefore,
      for him to subject himself to further humiliation. Yes, but the notes, the
      notes!&mdash;that thought renewed his strength. He wiped the perspiration
      from his forehead and started once more to try his luck with a customer in
      the faubourg. But this time he took his precautions and called to the
      cashier from the doorway, without entering:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Pere So-and-So. I want to ask you a question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held the door half open, his hand upon the knob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did we settle our last bill? I forgot to enter it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh! it was a long while ago, a very long while, that their last bill was
      settled. Fromont Jeune&rsquo;s receipt was dated in September. It was five
      months ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was hastily closed. Another! Evidently it would be the same thing
      everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Monsieur Chorche, Monsieur Chorche,&rdquo; muttered poor Sigismond; and
      while he pursued his journey, with bowed head and trembling legs, Madame
      Fromont Jeune&rsquo;s carriage passed him close, on its way to the Orleans
      station; but Claire did not see old Planus, any more than she had seen,
      when she left her house a few moments earlier, Monsieur Chebe in his long
      frock-coat and the illustrious Delobelle in his stovepipe hat, turning
      into the Rue des Vieilles-Haudriettes at opposite ends, each with the
      factory and Risler&rsquo;s wallet for his objective point. The young woman was
      much too deeply engrossed by what she had before her to look into the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of it! It was horrible. To go and ask M. Gardinois for a hundred
      thousand francs&mdash;M. Gardinois, a man who boasted that he had never
      borrowed or loaned a sou in his life, who never lost an opportunity to
      tell how, on one occasion, being driven to ask his father for forty francs
      to buy a pair of trousers, he had repaid the loan in small amounts. In his
      dealings with everybody, even with his children, M. Gardinois followed
      those traditions of avarice which the earth, the cruel earth, often
      ungrateful to those who till it, seems to inculcate in all peasants. The
      old man did not intend that any part of his colossal fortune should go to
      his children during his lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll find my property when I am dead,&rdquo; he often said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acting upon that principle, he had married off his daughter, the elder
      Madame Fromont, without one sou of dowry, and he never forgave his
      son-in-law for having made a fortune without assistance from him. For it
      was one of the peculiarities of that nature, made up of vanity and
      selfishness in equal parts, to wish that every one he knew should need his
      help, should bow before his wealth. When the Fromonts expressed in his
      presence their satisfaction at the prosperous turn their business was
      beginning to take, his sharp, cunning, little blue eye would smile
      ironically, and he would growl, &ldquo;We shall see what it all comes to in the
      end,&rdquo; in a tone that made them tremble. Sometimes, too, at Savigny, in the
      evening, when the park, the avenues, the blue slates of the chateau, the
      red brick of the stables, the ponds and brooks shone resplendent, bathed
      in the golden glory of a lovely sunset, this eccentric parvenu would say
      aloud before his children, after looking about him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one thing that consoles me for dying some day is that no one in the
      family will ever be rich enough to keep a chateau that costs fifty
      thousand francs a year to maintain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And yet, with that latter-day tenderness which even the sternest
      grandfathers find in the depths of their hearts, old Gardinois would
      gladly have made a pet of his granddaughter. But Claire, even as a child,
      had felt an invincible repugnance for the former peasant&rsquo;s hardness of
      heart and vainglorious selfishness. And when affection forms no bonds
      between those who are separated by difference in education, such
      repugnance is increased by innumerable trifles. When Claire married
      Georges, the grandfather said to Madame Fromont:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your daughter wishes, I will give her a royal present; but she must
      ask for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Claire received nothing, because she would not ask for anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a bitter humiliation to come, three years later, to beg a hundred
      thousand francs from the generosity she had formerly spurned, to humble
      herself, to face the endless sermons, the sneering raillery, the whole
      seasoned with Berrichon jests, with phrases smacking of the soil, with the
      taunts, often well-deserved, which narrow, but logical, minds can utter on
      occasion, and which sting with their vulgar patois like an insult from an
      inferior!
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Claire! Her husband and her father were about to be humiliated in her
      person. She must necessarily confess the failure of the one, the downfall
      of the house which the other had founded and of which he had been so proud
      while he lived. The thought that she would be called upon to defend all
      that she loved best in the world made her strong and weak at the same
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was eleven o&rsquo;clock when she reached Savigny. As she had given no
      warning of her visit, the carriage from the chateau was not at the
      station, and she had no choice but to walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a cold morning and the roads were dry and hard. The north wind blew
      freely across the arid fields and the river, and swept unopposed through
      the leafless trees and bushes. The chateau appeared under the low-hanging
      clouds, with its long line of low walls and hedges separating it from the
      surrounding fields. The slates on the roof were as dark as the sky they
      reflected; and that magnificent summer residence, completely transformed
      by the bitter, silent winter, without a leaf on its trees or a pigeon on
      its roofs, showed no life save in its rippling brooks and the murmuring of
      the tall poplars as they bowed majestically to one another, shaking the
      magpies&rsquo; nests hidden among their highest branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a distance Claire fancied that the home of her youth wore a surly,
      depressed air. It seemed to het that Savigny watched her approach with the
      cold, aristocratic expression which it assumed for passengers on the
      highroad, who stopped at the iron bars of its gateways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! the cruel aspect of everything!
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet not so cruel after all. For, with its tightly closed exterior,
      Savigny seemed to say to her, &ldquo;Begone&mdash;do not come in!&rdquo; And if she
      had chosen to listen, Claire, renouncing her plan of speaking to her
      grandfather, would have returned at once to Paris to maintain the repose
      of her life. But she did not understand, poor child! and already the great
      Newfoundland dog, who had recognized her, came leaping through the dead
      leaves and sniffed at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Francoise. Where is grandpapa?&rdquo; the young woman asked the
      gardener&rsquo;s wife, who came to open the gate, fawning and false and
      trembling, like all the servants at the chateau when they felt that the
      master&rsquo;s eye was upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandpapa was in his office, a little building independent of the main
      house, where he passed his days fumbling among boxes and pigeonholes and
      great books with green backs, with the rage for bureaucracy due to his
      early ignorance and the strong impression made upon him long before by the
      office of the notary in his village.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment he was closeted there with his keeper, a sort of country
      spy, a paid informer who apprised him as to all that was said and done in
      the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the master&rsquo;s favorite. His name was Fouinat (polecat), and he had
      the flat, crafty, blood-thirsty face appropriate to his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Claire entered, pale and trembling under her furs, the old man
      understood that something serious and unusual had happened, and he made a
      sign to Fouinat, who disappeared, gliding through the half-open door as if
      he were entering the very wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, little one? Why, you&rsquo;re all &lsquo;perlute&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the
      grandfather, seated behind his huge desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perlute, in the Berrichon dictionary, signifies troubled, excited, upset,
      and applied perfectly to Claire&rsquo;s condition. Her rapid walk in the cold
      country air, the effort she had made in order to do what she was doing,
      imparted an unwonted expression to her face, which was much less reserved
      than usual. Without the slightest encouragement on his part, she kissed
      him and seated herself in front of the fire, where old stumps, surrounded
      by dry moss and pine needles picked up in the paths, were smouldering with
      occasional outbursts of life and the hissing of sap. She did not even take
      time to shake off the frost that stood in beads on her veil, but began to
      speak at once, faithful to her resolution to state the object of her visit
      immediately upon entering the room, before she allowed herself to be
      intimidated by the atmosphere of fear and respect which encompassed the
      grandfather and made of him a sort of awe-inspiring deity.
    </p>
    <p>
      She required all her courage not to become confused, not to interrupt her
      narrative before that piercing gaze which transfixed her, enlivened from
      her first words by a malicious joy, before that savage mouth whose corners
      seemed tightly closed by premeditated reticence, obstinacy, a denial of
      any sort of sensibility. She went on to the end in one speech, respectful
      without humility, concealing her emotion, steadying her voice by the
      consciousness of the truth of her story. Really, seeing them thus face to
      face, he cold and calm, stretched out in his armchair, with his hands in
      the pockets of his gray swansdown waistcoat, she carefully choosing her
      words, as if each of them might condemn or absolve her, you would never
      have said that it was a child before her grandfather, but an accused
      person before an examining magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts were entirely engrossed by the joy, the pride of his triumph.
      So they were conquered at last, those proud upstarts of Fromonts! So they
      needed old Gardinois at last, did they? Vanity, his dominating passion,
      overflowed in his whole manner, do what he would. When she had finished,
      he took the floor in his turn, began naturally enough with &ldquo;I was sure of
      it&mdash;I always said so&mdash;I knew we should see what it would all
      come to&rdquo;&mdash;and continued in the same vulgar, insulting tone, ending
      with the declaration that, in view of his principles, which were well
      known in the family, he would not lend a sou.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Claire spoke of her child, of her husband&rsquo;s name, which was also her
      father&rsquo;s, and which would be dishonored by the failure. The old man was as
      cold, as implacable as ever, and took advantage of her humiliation to
      humiliate her still more; for he belonged to the race of worthy rustics
      who, when their enemy is down, never leave him without leaving on his face
      the marks of the nails in their sabots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I can say to you, little one, is that Savigny is open to you. Let
      your husband come here. I happen to need a secretary. Very well, Georges
      can do my writing for twelve hundred francs a year and board for the whole
      family. Offer him that from me, and come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose indignantly. She had come as his child and he had received her as
      a beggar. They had not reached that point yet, thank God!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; queried M. Gardinois, with a savage light in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire shuddered and walked toward the door without replying. The old man
      detained her with a gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care! you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re refusing. It is in your interest,
      you understand, that I suggest bringing your husband here. You don&rsquo;t know
      the life he is leading up yonder. Of course you don&rsquo;t know it, or you&rsquo;d
      never come and ask me for money to go where yours has gone. Ah! I know all
      about your man&rsquo;s affairs. I have my police at Paris, yes, and at Asnieres,
      as well as at Savigny. I know what the fellow does with his days and his
      nights; and I don&rsquo;t choose that my crowns shall go to the places where he
      goes. They&rsquo;re not clean enough for money honestly earned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Claire&rsquo;s eyes opened wide in amazement and horror, for she felt that a
      terrible drama had entered her life at that moment through the little low
      door of denunciation. The old man continued with a sneer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That little Sidonie has fine, sharp teeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sidonie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, yes, to be sure. I have told you the name. At all events, you&rsquo;d
      have found it out some day or other. In fact, it&rsquo;s an astonishing thing
      that, since the time&mdash;But you women are so vain! The idea that a man
      can deceive you is the last idea to come into your head. Well, yes,
      Sidonie&rsquo;s the one who has got it all out of him&mdash;with her husband&rsquo;s
      consent, by the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went on pitilessly to tell the young wife the source of the money for
      the house at Asnieres, the horses, the carriages, and how the pretty
      little nest in the Avenue Gabriel had been furnished. He explained
      everything in detail. It was clear that, having found a new opportunity to
      exercise his mania for espionage, he had availed himself of it to the
      utmost; perhaps, too, there was at the bottom of it all a vague, carefully
      concealed rage against his little Chebe, the anger of a senile passion
      never declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire listened to him without speaking, with a smile of incredulity. That
      smile irritated the old man, spurred on his malice. &ldquo;Ah! you don&rsquo;t believe
      me. Ah! you want proofs, do you?&rdquo; And he gave her proofs, heaped them upon
      her, overpowered her with knife-thrusts in the heart. She had only to go
      to Darches, the jeweller in the Rue de la Paix. A fortnight before,
      Georges had bought a diamond necklace there for thirty thousand francs. It
      was his New Year&rsquo;s gift to Sidonie. Thirty thousand francs for diamonds at
      the moment of becoming bankrupt!
    </p>
    <p>
      He might have talked the entire day and Claire would not have interrupted
      him. She felt that the slightest effort would cause the tears that filled
      her eyes to overflow, and she was determined to smile to the end, the
      sweet, brave woman. From time to time she cast a sidelong glance at the
      road. She was in haste to go, to fly from the sound of that spiteful
      voice, which pursued her pitilessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he ceased; he had told the whole story. She bowed and walked
      toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going? What a hurry you&rsquo;re in!&rdquo; said the grandfather, following
      her outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      At heart he was a little ashamed of his savagery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you breakfast with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, not having strength to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least wait till the carriage is ready&mdash;some one will drive you to
      the station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, still no.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she walked on, with the old man close behind her. Proudly, and with
      head erect, she crossed the courtyard, filled with souvenirs of her
      childhood, without once looking behind. And yet what echoes of hearty
      laughter, what sunbeams of her younger days were imprinted in the tiniest
      grain of gravel in that courtyard!
    </p>
    <p>
      Her favorite tree, her favorite bench, were still in the same place. She
      had not a glance for them, nor for the pheasants in the aviary, nor even
      for the great dog Kiss, who followed her docilely, awaiting the caress
      which she did not give him. She had come as a child of the house, she went
      away as a stranger, her mind filled with horrible thoughts which the
      slightest reminder of her peaceful and happy past could not have failed to
      aggravate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the gate closed upon her harshly. As soon as she was alone, she began
      to walk swiftly, swiftly, almost to run. She was not merely going away,
      she was escaping. Suddenly, when she reached the end of the wall of the
      estate, she found herself in front of the little green gate, surrounded by
      nasturtiums and honeysuckle, where the chateau mail-box was. She stopped
      instinctively, struck by one of those sudden awakenings of the memory
      which take place within us at critical moments and place before our eyes
      with wonderful clearness of outline the most trivial acts of our lives
      bearing any relation to present disasters or joys. Was it the red sun that
      suddenly broke forth from the clouds, flooding the level expanse with its
      oblique rays in that winter afternoon as at the sunset hour in August? Was
      it the silence that surrounded her, broken only by the harmonious sounds
      of nature, which are almost alike at all seasons?
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the cause she saw herself once more as she was, at that same
      spot, three years before, on a certain day when she placed in the post a
      letter inviting Sidonie to come and pass a month with her in the country.
      Something told her that all her misfortunes dated from that moment. &ldquo;Ah!
      had I known&mdash;had I only known!&rdquo; And she fancied that she could still
      feel between her fingers the smooth envelope, ready to drop into the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon, as she reflected what an innocent, hopeful, happy child she was
      at that moment, she cried out indignantly, gentle creature that she was,
      against the injustice of life. She asked herself: &ldquo;Why is it? What have I
      done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she suddenly exclaimed: &ldquo;No! it isn&rsquo;t true. It can not be possible.
      Grandfather lied to me.&rdquo; And as she went on toward the station, the
      unhappy girl tried to convince herself, to make herself believe what she
      said. But she did not succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth dimly seen is like the veiled sun, which tires the eyes far more
      than its most brilliant rays. In the semi-obscurity which still enveloped
      her misfortune, the poor woman&rsquo;s sight was keener than she could have
      wished. Now she understood and accounted for certain peculiar
      circumstances in her husband&rsquo;s life, his frequent absences, his
      restlessness, his embarrassed behavior on certain days, and the abundant
      details which he sometimes volunteered, upon returning home, concerning
      his movements, mentioning names as proofs which she did not ask. From all
      these conjectures the evidence of his sin was made up. And still she
      refused to believe it, and looked forward to her arrival in Paris to set
      her doubts at rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one was at the station, a lonely, cheerless little place, where no
      traveller ever showed his face in winter. As Claire sat there awaiting the
      train, gazing vaguely at the station-master&rsquo;s melancholy little garden,
      and the debris of climbing plants running along the fences by the track,
      she felt a moist, warm breath on her glove. It was her friend Kiss, who
      had followed her and was reminding her of their happy romps together in
      the old days, with little shakes of the head, short leaps, capers of joy
      tempered by humility, concluding by stretching his beautiful white coat at
      full length at his mistress&rsquo;s feet, on the cold floor of the waiting-room.
      Those humble caresses which sought her out, like a hesitating offer of
      devotion and sympathy, caused the sobs she had so long restrained to break
      forth as last. But suddenly she felt ashamed of her weakness. She rose and
      sent the dog away, sent him away pitilessly with voice and gesture,
      pointing to the house in the distance, with a stern face which poor Kiss
      had never seen. Then she hastily wiped her eyes and her moist hands; for
      the train for Paris was approaching and she knew that in a moment she
      should need all her courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire&rsquo;s first thought on leaving the train was to take a cab and drive to
      the jeweller in the Rue de la Paix, who had, as her grandfather alleged,
      supplied Georges with a diamond necklace. If that should prove to be true,
      then all the rest was true. Her dread of learning the truth was so great
      that, when she reached her destination and alighted in front of that
      magnificent establishment, she stopped, afraid to enter. To give herself
      countenance, she pretended to be deeply interested in the jewels displayed
      in velvet cases; and one who had seen her, quietly but fashionably
      dressed, leaning forward to look at that gleaming and attractive display,
      would have taken her for a happy wife engaged in selecting a bracelet,
      rather than an anxious, sorrow-stricken soul who had come thither to
      discover the secret of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. At that time of day, in winter, the
      Rue de la Paix presents a truly dazzling aspect. In that luxurious
      neighborhood, life moves quickly between the short morning and the early
      evening. There are carriages moving swiftly in all directions, a ceaseless
      rumbling, and on the sidewalks a coquettish haste, a rustling of silks and
      furs. Winter is the real Parisian season. To see that devil&rsquo;s own Paris in
      all its beauty and wealth and happiness one must watch the current of its
      life beneath a lowering sky, heavy with snow. Nature is absent from the
      picture, so to speak. No wind, no sunlight. Just enough light for the
      dullest colors, the faintest reflections to produce an admirable effect,
      from the reddish-gray tone of the monuments to the gleams of jet which
      bespangle a woman&rsquo;s dress. Theatre and concert posters shine resplendent,
      as if illumined by the effulgence of the footlights. The shops are
      crowded. It seems that all those people must be preparing for perpetual
      festivities. And at such times, if any sorrow is mingled with that bustle
      and tumult, it seems the more terrible for that reason. For five minutes
      Claire suffered martyrdom worse than death. Yonder, on the road to
      Savigny, in the vast expanse of the deserted fields, her despair spread
      out as it were in the sharp air and seemed to enfold her less closely.
      Here she was stifling. The voices beside her, the footsteps, the heedless
      jostling of people who passed, all added to her torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she entered the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes, Madame, certainly&mdash;Monsieur Fromont. A necklace of diamonds
      and roses. We could make you one like it for twenty-five thousand francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was five thousand less than for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, Monsieur,&rdquo; said Claire, &ldquo;I will think it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A mirror in front of her, in which she saw her dark-ringed eyes and her
      deathly pallor, frightened her. She went out quickly, walking stiffly in
      order not to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had but one idea, to escape from the street, from the noise; to be
      alone, quite alone, so that she might plunge headlong into that abyss of
      heartrending thoughts, of black things dancing madly in the depths of her
      mind. Oh! the coward, the infamous villain! And to think that only last
      night she was speaking comforting words to him, with her arms about him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, with no knowledge of how it happened, she found herself in the
      courtyard of the factory. Through what streets had she come? Had she come
      in a carriage or on foot? She had no remembrance. She had acted
      unconsciously, as in a dream. The sentiment of reality returned, pitiless
      and poignant, when she reached the steps of her little house. Risler was
      there, superintending several men who were carrying potted plants up to
      his wife&rsquo;s apartments, in preparation for the magnificent party she was to
      give that very evening. With his usual tranquillity he directed the work,
      protected the tall branches which the workmen might have broken: &ldquo;Not like
      that. Bend it over. Take care of the carpet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The atmosphere of pleasure and merry-making which had so revolted her a
      moment before pursued her to her own house. It was too much, after all the
      rest! She rebelled; and as Risler saluted her, affectionately and with
      deep respect as always, her face assumed an expression of intense disgust,
      and she passed without speaking to him, without seeing the amazement that
      opened his great, honest eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment her course was determined. Wrath, a wrath born of
      uprightness and sense of justice, guided her actions. She barely took time
      to kiss her child&rsquo;s rosy cheeks before running to her mother&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, mamma, dress yourself quickly. We are going away. We are going
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady rose slowly from the armchair in which she was sitting,
      busily engaged in cleaning her watch-chain by inserting a pin between
      every two links with infinite care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, hurry. Get your things ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice trembled, and the poor monomaniac&rsquo;s room seemed a horrible place
      to her, all glistening as it was with the cleanliness that had gradually
      become a mania. She had reached one of those fateful moments when the loss
      of one illusion causes you to lose them all, enables you to look to the
      very depths of human misery. The realization of her complete isolation,
      between her half-mad mother, her faithless husband, her too young child,
      came upon her for the first time; but it served only to strengthen her in
      her resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the whole household was busily engaged in making preparations
      for this abrupt, unexpected departure. Claire hurried the bewildered
      servants, and dressed her mother and the child, who laughed merrily amid
      all the excitement. She was in haste to go before Georges&rsquo; return, so that
      he might find the cradle empty and the house deserted. Where should she
      go? She did not know as yet. Perhaps to her aunt at Orleans, perhaps to
      Savigny, no matter where. What she must do first of all was-go, fly from
      that atmosphere of treachery and falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment she was in her bedroom, packing a trunk, making a pile of
      her effects&mdash;a heartrending occupation. Every object that she touched
      set in motion whole worlds of thoughts, of memories. There is so much of
      ourselves in anything that we use. At times the odor of a sachet-bag, the
      pattern of a bit of lace, were enough to bring tears to her eyes. Suddenly
      she heard a heavy footstep in the salon, the door of which was partly
      open; then there was a slight cough, as if to let her know that some one
      was there. She supposed that it was Risler: for no one else had the right
      to enter her apartments so unceremoniously. The idea of having to endure
      the presence of that hypocritical face, that false smile, was so
      distasteful to her that she rushed to close the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not at home to any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door resisted her efforts, and Sigismond&rsquo;s square head appeared in the
      opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I, Madame,&rdquo; he said in an undertone. &ldquo;I have come to get the
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What money?&rdquo; demanded Claire, for she no longer remembered why she had
      gone to Savigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! The funds to meet my note to-morrow. Monsieur Georges, when he went
      out, told me that you would hand it to me very soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes&mdash;true. The hundred thousand francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t them, Monsieur Planus; I haven&rsquo;t anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the cashier, in a strange voice, as if he were speaking to
      himself, &ldquo;then it means failure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he turned slowly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Failure! She sank on a chair, appalled, crushed. For the last few hours
      the downfall of her happiness had caused her to forget the downfall of the
      house; but she remembered now.
    </p>
    <p>
      So her husband was ruined! In a little while, when he returned home, he
      would learn of the disaster, and he would learn at the same time that his
      wife and child had gone; that he was left alone in the midst of the wreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone&mdash;that weak, easily influenced creature, who could only weep and
      complain and shake his fist at life like a child! What would become of the
      miserable man?
    </p>
    <p>
      She pitied him, notwithstanding his great sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the thought came to her that she would perhaps seem to have fled at
      the approach of bankruptcy, of poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georges might say to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had I been rich, she would have forgiven me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ought she to allow him to entertain that doubt?
    </p>
    <p>
      To a generous, noble heart like Claire&rsquo;s nothing more than that was
      necessary to change her plans. Instantly she was conscious that her
      feeling of repugnance, of revolt, began to grow less bitter, and a sudden
      ray of light seemed to make her duty clearer to her. When they came to
      tell her that the child was dressed and the trunks ready, her mind was
      made up anew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; she replied gently. &ldquo;We are not going away.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXI. THE DAY OF RECKONING
    </h2>
    <p>
      The great clock of Saint-Gervais struck one in the morning. It was so cold
      that the fine snow, flying through the air, hardened as it fell, covering
      the pavements with a slippery, white blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler, wrapped in his cloak, was hastening home from the brewery through
      the deserted streets of the Marais. He had been celebrating, in company
      with his two faithful borrowers, Chebe and Delobelle, his first moment of
      leisure, the end of that almost endless period of seclusion during which
      he had been superintending the manufacture of his press, with all the
      searchings, the joys, and the disappointments of the inventor. It had been
      long, very long. At the last moment he had discovered a defect. The crane
      did not work well; and he had had to revise his plans and drawings. At
      last, on that very day, the new machine had been tried. Everything had
      succeeded to his heart&rsquo;s desire. The worthy man was triumphant. It seemed
      to him that he had paid a debt, by giving the house of Fromont the benefit
      of a new machine, which would lessen the labor, shorten the hours of the
      workmen, and at the same time double the profits and the reputation of the
      factory. He indulged in beautiful dreams as he plodded along. His
      footsteps rang out proudly, emphasized by the resolute and happy trend of
      his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quickening his pace, he reached the corner of Rue des
      Vieilles-Haudriettes. A long line of carriages was standing in front of
      the factory, and the light of their lanterns in the street, the shadows of
      the drivers seeking shelter from the snow in the corners and angles that
      those old buildings have retained despite the straightening of the
      sidewalks, gave an animated aspect to that deserted, silent quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! to be sure,&rdquo; thought the honest fellow, &ldquo;we have a ball at our
      house.&rdquo; He remembered that Sidonie was giving a grand musical and dancing
      party, which she had excused him from attending, by the way, knowing that
      he was very busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadows passed and repassed behind the fluttering veil of the curtains;
      the orchestra seemed to follow the movements of those stealthy apparitions
      with the rising and falling of its muffled notes. The guests were dancing.
      Risler let his eyes rest for a moment on that phantasmagoria of the ball,
      and fancied that he recognized Sidonie&rsquo;s shadow in a small room adjoining
      the salon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing erect in her magnificent costume, in the attitude of a
      pretty woman before her mirror. A shorter shadow behind her, Madame Dobson
      doubtless, was repairing some accident to the costume, re-tieing the knot
      of a ribbon tied about her neck, its long ends floating down to the
      flounces of the train. It was all very indistinct, but the woman&rsquo;s
      graceful figure was recognizable in those faintly traced outlines, and
      Risler tarried long admiring her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contrast on the first floor was most striking. There was no light
      visible, with the exception of a little lamp shining through the lilac
      hangings of the bedroom. Risler noticed that circumstance, and as the
      little girl had been ailing a few days before, he felt anxious about her,
      remembering Madame Georges&rsquo;s strange agitation when she passed him so
      hurriedly in the afternoon; and he retraced his steps as far as Pere
      Achille&rsquo;s lodge to inquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lodge was full. Coachmen were warming themselves around the stove,
      chatting and laughing amid the smoke from their pipes. When Risler
      appeared there was profound silence, a cunning, inquisitive, significant
      silence. They had evidently been speaking of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the Fromont child still sick?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not the child, Monsieur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Georges sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he was taken when he came home to-night. I went right off to get the
      doctor. He said that it wouldn&rsquo;t amount to anything&mdash;that all
      Monsieur needed was rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Risler closed the door Pere Achille added, under his breath, with the
      half-fearful, half-audacious insolence of an inferior, who would like to
      be listened to and yet not distinctly heard:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! &lsquo;dame&rsquo;, they&rsquo;re not making such a show on the first floor as they are
      on the second.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fromont jeune, on returning home during the evening, had found his wife
      with such a changed, heartbroken face, that he at once divined a
      catastrophe. But he had become so accustomed in the past two years to sin
      with impunity that it did not for one moment occur to him that his wife
      could have been informed of his conduct. Claire, for her part, to avoid
      humiliating him, was generous enough to speak only of Savigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandpapa refused,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The miserable man turned frightfully pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am lost&mdash;I am lost!&rdquo; he muttered two or three times in the wild
      accents of fever; and his sleepless nights, a last terrible scene which he
      had had with Sidonie, trying to induce her not to give this party on the
      eve of his downfall, M. Gardinois&rsquo; refusal, all these maddening things
      which followed so closely on one another&rsquo;s heels and had agitated him
      terribly, culminated in a genuine nervous attack. Claire took pity on him,
      put him to bed, and established herself by his side; but her voice had
      lost that affectionate intonation which soothes and persuades. There was
      in her gestures, in the way in which she arranged the pillow under the
      patient&rsquo;s head and prepared a quieting draught, a strange indifference,
      listlessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have ruined you!&rdquo; Georges said from time to time, as if to rouse
      her from that apathy which made him uncomfortable. She replied with a
      proud, disdainful gesture. Ah! if he had done only that to her!
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, however, his nerves became calmer, the fever subsided, and he
      fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remained to attend to his wants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my duty,&rdquo; she said to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her duty. She had reached that point with the man whom she had adored so
      blindly, with the hope of a long and happy life together.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the ball in Sidonie&rsquo;s apartments began to become very
      animated. The ceiling trembled rhythmically, for Madame had had all the
      carpets removed from her salons for the greater comfort of the dancers.
      Sometimes, too, the sound of voices reached Claire&rsquo;s ears in waves, and
      frequent tumultuous applause, from which one could divine the great number
      of the guests, the crowded condition of the rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire was lost in thought. She did not waste time in regrets, in
      fruitless lamentations. She knew that life was inflexible and that all the
      arguments in the world will not arrest the cruel logic of its inevitable
      progress. She did not ask herself how that man had succeeded in deceiving
      her so long&mdash;how he could have sacrificed the honor and happiness of
      his family for a mere caprice. That was the fact, and all her reflections
      could not wipe it out, could not repair the irreparable. The subject that
      engrossed her thoughts was the future. A new existence was unfolding
      before her eyes, dark, cruel, full of privation and toil; and, strangely
      enough, the prospect of ruin, instead of terrifying her, restored all her
      courage. The idea of the change of abode made necessary by the economy
      they would be obliged to practise, of work made compulsory for Georges and
      perhaps for herself, infused an indefinable energy into the distressing
      calmness of her despair. What a heavy burden of souls she would have with
      her three children: her mother, her child, and her husband! The feeling of
      responsibility prevented her giving way too much to her misfortune, to the
      wreck of her love; and in proportion as she forgot herself in the thought
      of the weak creatures she had to protect she realized more fully the
      meaning of the word &ldquo;sacrifice,&rdquo; so vague on careless lips, so serious
      when it becomes a rule of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the poor woman&rsquo;s thoughts during that sad vigil, a vigil of arms
      and tears, while she was preparing her forces for the great battle. Such
      was the scene lighted by the modest little lamp which Risler had seen from
      below, like a star fallen from the radiant chandeliers of the ballroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reassured by Pere Achille&rsquo;s reply, the honest fellow thought of going up
      to his bedroom, avoiding the festivities and the guests, for whom he cared
      little.
    </p>
    <p>
      On such occasions he used a small servants&rsquo; staircase communicating with
      the counting-room. So he walked through the many-windowed workshops, which
      the moon, reflected by the snow, made as light as at noonday. He breathed
      the atmosphere of the day of toil, a hot, stifling atmosphere, heavy with
      the odor of boiled talc and varnish. The papers spread out on the dryers
      formed long, rustling paths. On all sides tools were lying about, and
      blouses hanging here and there ready for the morrow. Risler never walked
      through the shops without a feeling of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he spied a light in Planus&rsquo;s office, at the end of that long line
      of deserted rooms. The old cashier was still at work, at one o&rsquo;clock in
      the morning! That was really most extraordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler&rsquo;s first impulse was to retrace his steps. In fact, since his
      unaccountable falling-out with Sigismond, since the cashier had adopted
      that attitude of cold silence toward him, he had avoided meeting him. His
      wounded friendship had always led him to shun an explanation; he had a
      sort of pride in not asking Planus why he bore him ill-will. But, on that
      evening, Risler felt so strongly the need of cordial sympathy, of pouring
      out his heart to some one, and then it was such an excellent opportunity
      for a tete-a-tete with his former friend, that he did not try to avoid him
      but boldly entered the counting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cashier was sitting there, motionless, among heaps of papers and great
      books, which he had been turning over, some of which had fallen to the
      floor. At the sound of his employer&rsquo;s footsteps he did not even lift his
      eyes. He had recognized Risler&rsquo;s step. The latter, somewhat abashed,
      hesitated a moment; then, impelled by one of those secret springs which we
      have within us and which guide us, despite ourselves, in the path of our
      destiny, he walked straight to the cashier&rsquo;s grating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sigismond,&rdquo; he said in a grave voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man raised his head and displayed a shrunken face down which two
      great tears were rolling, the first perhaps that that animate column of
      figures had ever shed in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are weeping, old man? What troubles you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And honest Risler, deeply touched, held out his hand to his friend, who
      hastily withdrew his. That movement of repulsion was so instinctive, so
      brutal, that all Risler&rsquo;s emotion changed to indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew himself up with stern dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I offer you my hand, Sigismond Planus!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I refuse to take it,&rdquo; said Planus, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a terrible pause, during which they heard the muffled music of
      the orchestra upstairs and the noise of the ball, the dull, wearing noise
      of floors shaken by the rhythmic movement of the dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you refuse to take my hand?&rdquo; demanded Risler simply, while the
      grating upon which he leaned trembled with a metallic quiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sigismond was facing him, with both hands on his desk, as if to emphasize
      and drive home what he was about to say in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Because you have ruined the house; because in a few hours a
      messenger from the Bank will come and stand where you are, to collect a
      hundred thousand francs; and because, thanks to you, I haven&rsquo;t a sou in
      the cash-box&mdash;that&rsquo;s the reason why!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Risler was stupefied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have ruined the house&mdash;I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse than that, Monsieur. You have allowed it to be ruined by your wife,
      and you have arranged with her to benefit by our ruin and your dishonor.
      Oh! I can see your game well enough. The money your wife has wormed out of
      the wretched Fromont, the house at Asnieres, the diamonds and all the rest
      is invested in her name, of course, out of reach of disaster; and of
      course you can retire from business now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Risler in a faint voice, a restrained voice
      rather, that was insufficient for the multitude of thoughts it strove to
      express; and as he stammered helplessly he drew the grating toward him
      with such force that he broke off a piece of it. Then he staggered, fell
      to the floor, and lay there motionless, speechless, retaining only, in
      what little life was still left in him, the firm determination not to die
      until he had justified himself. That determination must have been very
      powerful; for while his temples throbbed madly, hammered by the blood that
      turned his face purple, while his ears were ringing and his glazed eyes
      seemed already turned toward the terrible unknown, the unhappy man
      muttered to himself in a thick voice, like the voice of a shipwrecked man
      speaking with his mouth full of water in a howling gale: &ldquo;I must live! I
      must live!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he recovered consciousness, he was sitting on the cushioned bench on
      which the workmen sat huddled together on pay-day, his cloak on the floor,
      his cravat untied, his shirt open at the neck, cut by Sigismond&rsquo;s knife.
      Luckily for him, he had cut his hands when he tore the grating apart; the
      blood had flowed freely, and that accident was enough to avert an attack
      of apoplexy. On opening his eyes, he saw on either side old Sigismond and
      Madame Georges, whom the cashier had summoned in his distress. As soon as
      Risler could speak, he said to her in a choking voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this true, Madame Chorche&mdash;is this true that he just told me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had not the courage to deceive him, so she turned her eyes away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; continued the poor fellow, &ldquo;so the house is ruined, and I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Risler, my friend. No, not you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife, was it not? Oh! it is horrible! This is how I have paid my debt
      of gratitude to you. But you, Madame Chorche, you could not have believed
      that I was a party to this infamy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my friend, no; be calm. I know that you are the most honorable man on
      earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her a moment, with trembling lips and clasped hands, for
      there was something child-like in all the manifestations of that artless
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Madame Chorche, Madame Chorche,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;When I think that I am
      the one who has ruined you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the terrible blow which overwhelmed him, and by which his heart,
      overflowing with love for Sidonie, was most deeply wounded, he refused to
      see anything but the financial disaster to the house of Fromont, caused by
      his blind devotion to his wife. Suddenly he stood erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let us not give way to emotion. We must see about
      settling our accounts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Fromont was frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Risler, Risler&mdash;where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thought that he was going up to Georges&rsquo; room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler understood her and smiled in superb disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never fear, Madame. Monsieur Georges can sleep in peace. I have something
      more urgent to do than avenge my honor as a husband. Wait for me here. I
      will come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He darted toward the narrow staircase; and Claire, relying upon his word,
      remained with Planus during one of those supreme moments of uncertainty
      which seem interminable because of all the conjectures with which they are
      thronged.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later the sound of hurried steps, the rustling of silk
      filled the dark and narrow staircase. Sidonie appeared first, in ball
      costume, gorgeously arrayed and so pale that the jewels that glistened
      everywhere on her dead-white flesh seemed more alive than she, as if they
      were scattered over the cold marble of a statue. The breathlessness due to
      dancing, the trembling of intense excitement and her rapid descent, caused
      her to shake from head to foot, and her floating ribbons, her ruffles, her
      flowers, her rich and fashionable attire drooped tragically about her.
      Risler followed her, laden with jewel-cases, caskets, and papers. Upon
      reaching his apartments he had pounced upon his wife&rsquo;s desk, seized
      everything valuable that it contained, jewels, certificates, title-deeds
      of the house at Asnieres; then, standing in the doorway, he had shouted
      into the ballroom:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Risler!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had run quickly to him, and that brief scene had in no wise disturbed
      the guests, then at the height of the evening&rsquo;s enjoyment. When she saw
      her husband standing in front of the desk, the drawers broken open and
      overturned on the carpet with the multitude of trifles they contained, she
      realized that something terrible was taking place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come at once,&rdquo; said Risler; &ldquo;I know all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tried to assume an innocent, dignified attitude; but he seized her by
      the arm with such force that Frantz&rsquo;s words came to her mind: &ldquo;It will
      kill him perhaps, but he will kill you first.&rdquo; As she was afraid of death,
      she allowed herself to be led away without resistance, and had not even
      the strength to lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; she asked, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler did not answer. She had only time to throw over her shoulders, with
      the care for herself that never failed her, a light tulle veil, and he
      dragged her, pushed her, rather, down the stairs leading to the
      counting-room, which he descended at the same time, his steps close upon
      hers, fearing that his prey would escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he said, as he entered the room. &ldquo;We have stolen, we make
      restitution. Look, Planus, you can raise money with all this stuff.&rdquo; And
      he placed on the cashier&rsquo;s desk all the fashionable plunder with which his
      arms were filled&mdash;feminine trinkets, trivial aids to coquetry,
      stamped papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned to his wife:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take off your jewels! Come, be quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She complied slowly, opened reluctantly the clasps of bracelets and
      buckles, and above all the superb fastening of her diamond necklace on
      which the initial of her name-a gleaming S-resembled a sleeping serpent,
      imprisoned in a circle of gold. Risler, thinking that she was too slow,
      ruthlessly broke, the fragile fastenings. Luxury shrieked beneath his
      fingers, as if it were being whipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now it is my turn,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I too must give up everything. Here is my
      portfolio. What else have I? What else have I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He searched his pockets feverishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my watch. With the chain it will bring four-thousand francs. My
      rings, my wedding-ring. Everything goes into the cash-box, everything. We
      have a hundred thousand francs to pay this morning. As soon as it is
      daylight we must go to work, sell out and pay our debts. I know some one
      who wants the house at Asnieres. That can be settled at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He alone spoke and acted. Sigismond and Madame Georges watched him without
      speaking. As for Sidonie, she seemed unconscious, lifeless. The cold air
      blowing from the garden through the little door, which was opened at the
      time of Risler&rsquo;s swoon, made her shiver, and she mechanically drew the
      folds of her scarf around her shoulders, her eyes fixed on vacancy, her
      thoughts wandering. Did she not hear the violins of her ball, which
      reached their ears in the intervals of silence, like bursts of savage
      irony, with the heavy thud of the dancers shaking the floors? An iron
      hand, falling upon her, aroused her abruptly from her torpor. Risler had
      taken her by the arm, and, leading her before his partner&rsquo;s wife, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down on your knees!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Fromont drew back, remonstrating:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Risler, not that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be,&rdquo; said the implacable Risler. &ldquo;Restitution, reparation! Down
      on your knees then, wretched woman!&rdquo; And with irresistible force he threw
      Sidonie at Claire&rsquo;s feet; then, still holding her arm;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will repeat after me, word for word, what I say: Madame&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sidonie, half dead with fear, repeated faintly: &ldquo;Madame&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A whole lifetime of humility and submission&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A whole lifetime of humil&mdash;No, I can not!&rdquo; she exclaimed, springing
      to her feet with the agility of a deer; and, wresting herself from
      Risler&rsquo;s grasp, through that open door which had tempted her from the
      beginning of this horrible scene, luring her out into the darkness of the
      night to the liberty obtainable by flight, she rushed from the house,
      braving the falling snow and the wind that stung her bare shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop her, stop her!&mdash;Risler, Planus, I implore you! In pity&rsquo;s name
      do not let her go in this way,&rdquo; cried Claire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Planus stepped toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler detained him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forbid you to stir! I ask your pardon, Madame, but we have more
      important matters than this to consider. Madame Risler concerns us no
      longer. We have to save the honor of the house of Fromont, which alone is
      at stake, which alone fills my thoughts at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sigismond put out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a noble man, Risler. Forgive me for having suspected you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Risler pretended not to hear him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred thousand francs to pay, you say? How much is there left in the
      strong-box?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat bravely down behind the gratin, looking over the books of account,
      the certificates of stock in the funds, opening the jewel-cases,
      estimating with Planus, whose father had been a jeweller, the value of all
      those diamonds, which he had once so admired on his wife, having no
      suspicion of their real value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Claire, trembling from head to foot, looked out through the
      window at the little garden, white with snow, where Sidonie&rsquo;s footsteps
      were already effaced by the fast-falling flakes, as if to bear witness
      that that precipitate departure was without hope of return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up-stairs they were still dancing. The mistress of the house was supposed
      to be busy with the preparations for supper, while she was flying,
      bare-headed, forcing back sobs and shrieks of rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where was she going? She had started off like a mad woman, running across
      the garden and the courtyard of the factory, and under the dark arches,
      where the cruel, freezing wind blew in eddying circles. Pere Achille did
      not recognize her; he had seen so many shadows wrapped in white pass his
      lodge that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman&rsquo;s first thought was to join the tenor Cazaboni, whom at
      the last she had not dared to invite to her ball; but he lived at
      Montmartre, and that was very far away for her to go, in that garb; and
      then, would he be at home? Her parents would take her in, doubtless; but
      she could already hear Madame Chebe&rsquo;s lamentations and the little man&rsquo;s
      sermon under three heads. Thereupon she thought of Delobelle, her old
      Delobelle. In the downfall of all her splendors she remembered the man who
      had first initiated her into fashionable life, who had given her lessons
      in dancing and deportment when she was a little girl, laughed at her
      pretty ways, and taught her to look upon herself as beautiful before any
      one had ever told her that she was so. Something told her that that fallen
      star would take her part against all others. She entered one of the
      carriages standing at the gate and ordered the driver to take her to the
      actor&rsquo;s lodgings on the Boulevard Beaumarchais.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time past Mamma Delobelle had been making straw hats for export-a
      dismal trade if ever there was one, which brought in barely two francs
      fifty for twelve hours&rsquo; work.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Delobelle continued to grow fat in the same degree that his &ldquo;sainted
      wife&rdquo; grew thin. At the very moment when some one knocked hurriedly at his
      door he had just discovered a fragrant soup &lsquo;au fromage&rsquo;, which had been
      kept hot in the ashes on the hearth. The actor, who had been witnessing at
      Beaumarchais some dark-browed melodrama drenched with gore even to the
      illustrated headlines of its poster, was startled by that knock at such an
      advanced hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; he asked in some alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I, Sidonie. Open the door quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She entered the room, shivering all over, and, throwing aside her wrap,
      went close to the stove where the fire was almost extinct. She began to
      talk at once, to pour out the wrath that had been stifling her for an
      hour, and while she was describing the scene in the factory, lowering her
      voice because of Madame Delobelle, who was asleep close by, the
      magnificence of her costume in that poor, bare, fifth floor, the dazzling
      whiteness of her disordered finery amid the heaps of coarse hats and the
      wisps of straw strewn about the room, all combined to produce the effect
      of a veritable drama, of one of those terrible upheavals of life when
      rank, feelings, fortunes are suddenly jumbled together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I never shall return home. It is all over. Free&mdash;I am free!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who could have betrayed you to your husband?&rdquo; asked the actor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Frantz! I am sure it was Frantz. He wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it from
      anybody else. Only last evening a letter came from Egypt. Oh! how he
      treated me before that woman! To force me to kneel! But I&rsquo;ll be revenged.
      Luckily I took something to revenge myself with before I came away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the smile of former days played about the corners of her pale lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old strolling player listened to it all with deep interest.
      Notwithstanding his compassion for that poor devil of a Risler, and for
      Sidonie herself, for that matter, who seemed to him, in theatrical
      parlance, &ldquo;a beautiful culprit,&rdquo; he could not help viewing the affair from
      a purely scenic standpoint, and finally cried out, carried away by his
      hobby:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a first-class situation for a fifth act!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not bear him. Absorbed by some evil thought, which made her smile
      in anticipation, she stretched out to the fire her dainty shoes, saturated
      with snow, and her openwork stockings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you propose to do now?&rdquo; Delobelle asked after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay here till daylight and get a little rest. Then I will see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no bed to offer you, my poor girl. Mamma Delobelle has gone to
      bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about me, my dear Delobelle. I&rsquo;ll sleep in that armchair.
      I won&rsquo;t be in your way, I tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The actor heaved a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes, that armchair. It was our poor Zizi&rsquo;s. She sat up many a night
      in it, when work was pressing. Ah, me! those who leave this world are much
      the happiest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had always at hand such selfish, comforting maxims. He had no sooner
      uttered that one than he discovered with dismay that his soup would soon
      be stone-cold. Sidonie noticed his movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you were just eating your supper, weren&rsquo;t you? Pray go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Dame&rsquo;! yes, what would you have? It&rsquo;s part of the trade, of the hard
      existence we fellows have. For you see, my girl, I stand firm. I haven&rsquo;t
      given up. I never will give up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What still remained of Desiree&rsquo;s soul in that wretched household in which
      she had lived twenty years must have shuddered at that terrible
      declaration. He never would give up!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter what people may say,&rdquo; continued Delobelle, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the noblest
      profession in the world. You are free; you depend upon nobody. Devoted to
      the service of glory and the public! Ah! I know what I would do in your
      place. As if you were born to live with all those bourgeois&mdash;the
      devil! What you need is the artistic life, the fever of success, the
      unexpected, intense emotion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he took his seat, tucked his napkin in his neck, and helped
      himself to a great plateful of soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To say nothing of the fact that your triumphs as a pretty woman would in
      no wise interfere with your triumph as an actress. By the way, do you
      know, you must take a few lessons in elocution. With your voice, your
      intelligence, your charms, you would have a magnificent prospect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he added abruptly, as if to initiate her into the joys of the
      dramatic art:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it occurs to me that perhaps you have not supped! Excitement makes
      one hungry; sit there, and take this soup. I am sure that you haven&rsquo;t
      eaten soup &lsquo;au fromage&rsquo; for a long while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned the closet topsy-turvy to find her a spoon and a napkin; and she
      took her seat opposite him, assisting him and laughing a little at the
      difficulties attending her entertainment. She was less pale already, and
      there was a pretty sparkle in her eyes, composed of the tears of a moment
      before and the present gayety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strolling actress! All her happiness in life was lost forever: honor,
      family, wealth. She was driven from her house, stripped, dishonored. She
      had undergone all possible humiliations and disasters. That did not
      prevent her supping with a wonderful appetite and joyously holding her own
      under Delobelle&rsquo;s jocose remarks concerning her vocation and her future
      triumphs. She felt light-hearted and happy, fairly embarked for the land
      of Bohemia, her true country. What more would happen to her? Of how many
      ups and downs was her new, unforeseen, and whimsical existence to consist?
      She thought about that as she fell asleep in Desiree&rsquo;s great easy-chair;
      but she thought of her revenge, too&mdash;her cherished revenge which she
      held in her hand, all ready for use, and so unerring, so fierce!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. THE NEW EMPLOYEE OF THE HOUSE OF FROMONT
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was broad daylight when Fromont Jeune awoke. All night long, between
      the drama that was being enacted below him and the festivity in joyous
      progress above, he slept with clenched fists, the deep sleep of complete
      prostration like that of a condemned man on the eve of his execution or of
      a defeated General on the night following his disaster; a sleep from which
      one would wish never to awake, and in which, in the absence of all
      sensation, one has a foretaste of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bright light streaming through his curtains, made more dazzling by the
      deep snow with which the garden and the surrounding roofs were covered,
      recalled him to the consciousness of things as they were. He felt a shock
      throughout his whole being, and, even before his mind began to work, that
      vague impression of melancholy which misfortunes, momentarily forgotten,
      leave in their place. All the familiar noises of the factory, the dull
      throbbing of the machinery, were in full activity. So the world still
      existed! and by slow degrees the idea of his own responsibility awoke in
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day is the day,&rdquo; he said to himself, with an involuntary movement
      toward the dark side of the room, as if he longed to bury himself anew in
      his long sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The factory bell rang, then other bells in the neighborhood, then the
      Angelus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noon! Already! How I have slept!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt some little remorse and a great sense of relief at the thought
      that the drama of settling-day had passed off without him. What had they
      done downstairs? Why did they not call him?
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, drew the curtains aside, and saw Risler and Sigismond talking
      together in the garden. And it was so long since they had spoken to each
      other! What in heaven&rsquo;s name had happened? When he was ready to go down he
      found Claire at the door of his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not go out,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay here. I will explain it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the matter? Did any one come from the Bank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they came&mdash;the notes are paid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Risler obtained the money. He has been rushing about with Planus since
      early morning. It seems that his wife had superb jewels. The diamond
      necklace alone brought twenty thousand francs. He has also sold their
      house at Asnieres with all it contained; but as time was required to
      record the deed, Planus and his sister advanced the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away from him as she spoke. He, on his side, hung his head to
      avoid her glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Risler is an honorable man,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;and when he learned from
      whom his wife received all her magnificent things&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Georges in dismay. &ldquo;He knows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All,&rdquo; Claire replied, lowering her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wretched man turned pale, stammered feebly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then&mdash;you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I knew it all before Risler. Remember, that when I came home last
      night, I told you I had heard very cruel things down at Savigny, and that
      I would have given ten years of my life not to have taken that journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Claire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moved by a mighty outburst of affection, he stepped toward his wife; but
      her face was so cold, so sad, so resolute, her despair was so plainly
      written in the stern indifference of her whole bearing, that he dared not
      take her in his arms as he longed to do, but simply murmured under his
      breath:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive!&mdash;forgive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must think me strangely calm,&rdquo; said the brave woman; &ldquo;but I shed all
      my tears yesterday. You may have thought that I was weeping over our ruin;
      you were mistaken. While one is young and strong as we are, such cowardly
      conduct is not permissible. We are armed against want and can fight it
      face to face. No, I was weeping for our departed happiness, for you, for
      the madness that led you to throw away your only, your true friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was lovely, lovelier than Sidonie had ever been, as she spoke thus,
      enveloped by a pure light which seemed to fall upon her from a great
      height, like the radiance of a fathomless, cloudless sky; whereas the
      other&rsquo;s irregular features had always seemed to owe their brilliancy,
      their saucy, insolent charm to the false glamour of the footlights in some
      cheap theatre. The touch of statuesque immobility formerly noticeable in
      Claire&rsquo;s face was vivified by anxiety, by doubt, by all the torture of
      passion; and like those gold ingots which have their full value only when
      the Mint has placed its stamp upon them, those beautiful features stamped
      with the effigy of sorrow had acquired since the preceding day an
      ineffaceable expression which perfected their beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georges gazed at her in admiration. She seemed to him more alive, more
      womanly, and worthy of adoration because of their separation and all the
      obstacles that he now knew to stand between them. Remorse, despair, shame
      entered his heart simultaneously with this new love, and he would have
      fallen on his knees before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, do not kneel,&rdquo; said Claire; &ldquo;if you knew of what you remind me,
      if you knew what a lying face, distorted with hatred, I saw at my feet
      last night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but I am not lying,&rdquo; replied Georges with a shudder. &ldquo;Claire, I
      implore you, in the name of our child&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment some one knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rise, I beg of you! You see that life has claims upon us,&rdquo; she said in a
      low voice and with a bitter smile; then she asked what was wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Risler had sent for Monsieur to come down to the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;say that he will come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Georges approached the door, but she stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, let me go. He must not see you yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you to stay here. You have no idea of the indignation and wrath of
      that poor man, whom you have deceived. If you had seen him last night,
      crushing his wife&rsquo;s wrists!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she said it she looked him in the face with a curiosity most cruel to
      herself; but Georges did not wince, and replied simply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My life belongs to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It belongs to me, too; and I do not wish you to go down. There has been
      scandal enough in my father&rsquo;s house. Remember that the whole factory is
      aware of what is going on. Every one is watching us, spying upon us. It
      required all the authority of the foremen to keep the men busy to-day, to
      compel them to keep their inquisitive looks on their work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shall seem to be hiding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose it were so! That is just like a man. They do not recoil from
      the worst crimes: betraying a wife, betraying a friend; but the thought
      that they may be accused of being afraid touches them more keenly than
      anything. Moreover, listen to what I say. Sidonie has gone; she has gone
      forever; and if you leave this house I shall think that you have gone to
      join her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I will stay,&rdquo; said Georges. &ldquo;I will do whatever you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Claire descended into Planus&rsquo; office.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see Risler striding to and fro, with his hands behind his back, as calm
      as usual, no one would ever have suspected all that had taken place in his
      life since the night before. As for Sigismond, he was fairly beaming, for
      he saw nothing in it all beyond the fact that the notes had been paid at
      maturity and that the honor of the firm was safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Madame Fromont appeared, Risler smiled sadly and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that you would prefer to come down in his place; but you are
      not the one with whom I have to deal. It is absolutely necessary that I
      should see Georges and talk with him. We have paid the notes that fell due
      this morning; the crisis has passed; but we must come to an understanding
      about many matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Risler, my friend, I beg you to wait a little longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Madame Chorche, there&rsquo;s not a minute to lose. Oh! I suspect that you
      fear I may give way to an outbreak of anger. Have no fear&mdash;let him
      have no fear. You know what I told you, that the honor of the house of
      Fromont is to be assured before my own. I have endangered it by my fault.
      First of all, I must repair the evil I have done or allowed to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your conduct toward us is worthy of all admiration, my good Risler; I
      know it well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Madame, if you could see him! he&rsquo;s a saint,&rdquo; said poor Sigismond,
      who, not daring to speak to his friend, was determined at all events to
      express his remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t you afraid?&rdquo; continued Claire. &ldquo;Human endurance has its
      limits. It may be that in presence of the man who has injured you so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Risler took her hands, gazed into her eyes with grave admiration, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dear creature, who speak of nothing but the injury done to me! Do you
      not know that I hate him as bitterly for his falseness to you? But nothing
      of that sort has any existence for me at this moment. You see in me simply
      a business man who wishes to have an understanding with his partner for
      the good of the firm. So let him come down without the slightest fear, and
      if you dread any outbreak on my part, stay here with us. I shall need only
      to look at my old master&rsquo;s daughter to be reminded of my promise and my
      duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust you, my friend,&rdquo; said Claire; and she went up to bring her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first minute of the interview was terrible. Georges was deeply moved,
      humiliated, pale as death. He would have preferred a hundred times over to
      be looking into the barrel of that man&rsquo;s pistol at twenty paces, awaiting
      his fire, instead of appearing before him as an unpunished culprit and
      being compelled to confine his feelings within the commonplace limits of a
      business conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler pretended not to look at him, and continued to pace the floor as he
      talked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our house is passing through a terrible crisis. We have averted the
      disaster for to-day; but this is not the last of our obligations. That
      cursed invention has kept my mind away from the business for a long while.
      Luckily, I am free now, and able to attend to it. But you must give your
      attention to it as well. The workmen and clerks have followed the example
      of their employers to some extent. Indeed, they have become extremely
      negligent and indifferent. This morning, for the first time in a year,
      they began work at the proper time. I expect that you will make it your
      business to change all that. As for me, I shall work at my drawings again.
      Our patterns are old-fashioned. We must have new ones for the new
      machines. I have great confidence in our presses. The experiments have
      succeeded beyond my hopes. We unquestionably have in them a means of
      building up our business. I didn&rsquo;t tell you sooner because I wished to
      surprise you; but we have no more surprises for each other, have we,
      Georges?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was such a stinging note of irony in his voice that Claire
      shuddered, fearing an outbreak; but he continued, in his natural tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think I can promise that in six months the Risler Press will begin
      to show magnificent results. But those six months will be very hard to
      live through. We must limit ourselves, cut down our expenses, save in
      every way that we can. We have five draughtsmen now; hereafter we will
      have but two. I will undertake to make the absence of the others of no
      consequence by working at night myself. Furthermore, beginning with this
      month, I abandon my interest in the firm. I will take my salary as foreman
      as I took it before, and nothing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fromont attempted to speak, but a gesture from his wife restrained him,
      and Risler continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am no longer your partner, Georges. I am once more the clerk that I
      never should have ceased to be. From this day our partnership articles are
      cancelled. I insist upon it, you understand; I insist upon it. We will
      remain in that relation to each other until the house is out of difficulty
      and I can&mdash;But what I shall do then concerns me alone. This is what I
      wanted to say to you, Georges. You must give your attention to the factory
      diligently; you must show yourself, make it felt that you are master now,
      and I believe there will turn out to be, among all our misfortunes, some
      that can be retrieved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the silence that followed, they heard the sound of wheels in the
      garden, and two great furniture vans stopped at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Risler, &ldquo;but I must leave you a moment. Those
      are the vans from the public auction rooms; they have come to take away my
      furniture from upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you are going to sell your furniture too?&rdquo; asked Madame Fromont.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly&mdash;to the last piece. I am simply giving it back to the
      firm. It belongs to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is impossible,&rdquo; said Georges. &ldquo;I can not allow that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Risler turned upon him indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? What is it that you can&rsquo;t allow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Claire checked him with an imploring gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True&mdash;true!&rdquo; he muttered; and he hurried from the room to escape the
      sudden temptation to give vent to all that was in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second floor was deserted. The servants, who had been paid and
      dismissed in the morning, had abandoned the apartments to the disorder of
      the day following a ball; and they wore the aspect peculiar to places
      where a drama has been enacted, and which are left in suspense, as it
      were, between the events that have happened and those that are still to
      happen. The open doors, the rugs lying in heaps in the corners, the
      salvers laden with glasses, the preparations for the supper, the table
      still set and untouched, the dust from the dancing on all the furniture,
      its odor mingled with the fumes of punch, of withered flowers, of
      rice-powder&mdash;all these details attracted Risler&rsquo;s notice as he
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the disordered salon the piano was open, the bacchanal from &lsquo;Orphee aux
      Enfers&rsquo; on the music-shelf, and the gaudy hangings surrounding that scene
      of desolation, the chairs overturned, as if in fear, reminded one of the
      saloon of a wrecked packet-boat, of one of those ghostly nights of
      watching when one is suddenly informed, in the midst of a fete at sea,
      that the ship has sprung a leak, that she is taking in water in every
      part.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men began to remove the furniture. Risler watched them at work with an
      indifferent air, as if he were in a stranger&rsquo;s house. That magnificence
      which had once made him so happy and proud inspired in him now an
      insurmountable disgust. But, when he entered his wife&rsquo;s bedroom, he was
      conscious of a vague emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a large room, hung with blue satin under white lace. A veritable
      cocotte&rsquo;s nest. There were torn and rumpled tulle ruffles lying about,
      bows, and artificial flowers. The wax candles around the mirror had burned
      down to the end and cracked the candlesticks; and the bed, with its lace
      flounces and valances, its great curtains raised and drawn back, untouched
      in the general confusion, seemed like the bed of a corpse, a state bed on
      which no one would ever sleep again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler&rsquo;s first feeling upon entering the room was one of mad indignation,
      a longing to fall upon the things before him, to tear and rend and shatter
      everything. Nothing, you see, resembles a woman so much as her bedroom.
      Even when she is absent, her image still smiles in the mirrors that have
      reflected it. A little something of her, of her favorite perfume, remains
      in everything she has touched. Her attitudes are reproduced in the
      cushions of her couch, and one can follow her goings and comings between
      the mirror and the toilette table in the pattern of the carpet. The one
      thing above all others in that room that recalled Sidonie was an &lsquo;etagere&rsquo; 
      covered with childish toys, petty, trivial knickknacks, microscopic fans,
      dolls&rsquo; tea-sets, gilded shoes, little shepherds and shepherdesses facing
      one another, exchanging cold, gleaming, porcelain glances. That &lsquo;etagere&rsquo; 
      was Sidonie&rsquo;s very soul, and her thoughts, always commonplace, petty,
      vain, and empty, resembled those gewgaws. Yes, in very truth, if Risler,
      while he held her in his grasp last night, had in his frenzy broken that
      fragile little head, a whole world of &lsquo;etagere&rsquo; ornaments would have come
      from it in place of a brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor man was thinking sadly of all these things amid the ringing of
      hammers and the heavy footsteps of the furniture-movers, when he heard an
      interloping, authoritative step behind him, and Monsieur Chebe appeared,
      little Monsieur Chebe, flushed and breathless, with flames darting from
      his eyes. He assumed, as always, a very high tone with his son-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this mean? What is this I hear? Ah! so you&rsquo;re moving, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not moving, Monsieur Chebe&mdash;I am selling out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little man gave a leap like a scalded fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are selling out? What are you selling, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am selling everything,&rdquo; said Risler in a hollow voice, without even
      looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, son-in-law, be reasonable. God knows I don&rsquo;t say that
      Sidonie&rsquo;s conduct&mdash;But, for my part, I know nothing about it. I never
      wanted to know anything. Only I must remind you of your dignity. People
      wash their dirty linen in private, deuce take it! They don&rsquo;t make
      spectacles of themselves as you&rsquo;ve been doing ever since morning. Just see
      everybody at the workshop windows; and on the porch, too! Why, you&rsquo;re the
      talk of the quarter, my dear fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better. The dishonor was public, the reparation must be
      public, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This apparent coolness, this indifference to all his observations,
      exasperated Monsieur Chebe. He suddenly changed his tactics, and adopted,
      in addressing his son-in-law, the serious, peremptory tone which one uses
      with children or lunatics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I say that you haven&rsquo;t any right to take anything away from here. I
      remonstrate formally, with all my strength as a man, with all my authority
      as a father. Do you suppose I am going to let you drive my child into the
      street. No, indeed! Oh! no, indeed! Enough of such nonsense as that!
      Nothing more shall go out of these rooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Monsieur Chebe, having closed the door, planted himself in front of it
      with a heroic gesture. Deuce take it! his own interest was at stake in the
      matter. The fact was that when his child was once in the gutter he ran
      great risk of not having a feather bed to sleep on himself. He was superb
      in that attitude of an indignant father, but he did not keep it long. Two
      hands, two vises, seized his wrists, and he found himself in the middle of
      the room, leaving the doorway clear for the workmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chebe, my boy, just listen,&rdquo; said Risler, leaning over him. &ldquo;I am at the
      end of my forbearance. Since this morning I have been making superhuman
      efforts to restrain myself, but it would take very little now to make my
      anger burst all bonds, and woe to the man on whom it falls! I am quite
      capable of killing some one. Come! Be off at once!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was such an intonation in his son-in-law&rsquo;s voice, and the way that
      son-in-law shook him as he spoke was so eloquent, that Monsieur Chebe was
      fully convinced. He even stammered an apology. Certainly Risler had good
      reason for acting as he had. All honorable people would be on his side.
      And he backed toward the door as he spoke. When he reached it, he inquired
      timidly if Madame Chebe&rsquo;s little allowance would be continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was Risler&rsquo;s reply, &ldquo;but never go beyond it, for my position here
      is not what it was. I am no longer a partner in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Chebe stared at him in amazement, and assumed the idiotic
      expression which led many people to believe that the accident that had
      happened to him&mdash;exactly like that of the Duc d&rsquo;Orleans, you know&mdash;was
      not a fable of his own invention; but he dared not make the slightest
      observation. Surely some one had changed his son-in-law. Was this really
      Risler, this tiger-cat, who bristled up at the slightest word and talked
      of nothing less than killing people?
    </p>
    <p>
      He took to his heels, recovered his self-possession at the foot of the
      stairs, and walked across the courtyard with the air of a conqueror.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all the rooms were cleared and empty, Risler walked through them for
      the last time, then took the key and went down to Planus&rsquo;s office to hand
      it to Madame Georges.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can let the apartment,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it will be so much added to the
      income of the factory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t need much. An iron bed up under the eaves. That&rsquo;s all a clerk
      needs. For, I repeat, I am nothing but a clerk from this time on. A useful
      clerk, by the way, faithful and courageous, of whom you will have no
      occasion to complain, I promise you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Georges, who was going over the books with Planus, was so affected at
      hearing the poor fellow talk in that strain that he left his seat
      precipitately. He was suffocated by his sobs. Claire, too, was deeply
      moved; she went to the new clerk of the house of Fromont and said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Risler, I thank you in my father&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Pere Achille appeared with the mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler took the pile of letters, opened them tranquilly one by one, and
      passed them over to Sigismond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s an order for Lyon. Why wasn&rsquo;t it answered at Saint-Etienne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He plunged with all his energy into these details, and he brought to them
      a keen intelligence, due to the constant straining of the mind toward
      peace and forgetfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, among those huge envelopes, stamped with the names of business
      houses, the paper of which and the manner of folding suggested the office
      and hasty despatch, he discovered one smaller one, carefully sealed, and
      hidden so cunningly between the others that at first he did not notice it.
      He recognized instantly that long, fine, firm writing,&mdash;To Monsieur
      Risler&mdash;Personal. It was Sidonie&rsquo;s writing! When he saw it he felt
      the same sensation he had felt in the bedroom upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      All his love, all the hot wrath of the betrayed husband poured back into
      his heart with the frantic force that makes assassins. What was she
      writing to him? What lie had she invented now? He was about to open the
      letter; then he paused. He realized that, if he should read that, it would
      be all over with his courage; so he leaned over to the old cashier, and
      said in an undertone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sigismond, old friend, will you do me a favor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so!&rdquo; said the worthy man enthusiastically. He was so
      delighted to hear his friend speak to him in the kindly voice of the old
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a letter someone has written me which I don&rsquo;t wish to read now. I
      am sure it would interfere with my thinking and living. You must keep it
      for me, and this with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took from his pocket a little package carefully tied, and handed it to
      him through the grating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all I have left of the past, all I have left of that woman. I
      have determined not to see her, nor anything that reminds me of her, until
      my task here is concluded, and concluded satisfactorily,&mdash;I need all
      my intelligence, you understand. You will pay the Chebes&rsquo; allowance. If
      she herself should ask for anything, you will give her what she needs. But
      you will never mention my name. And you will keep this package safe for me
      until I ask you for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sigismond locked the letter and the package in a secret drawer of his desk
      with other valuable papers. Risler returned at once to his correspondence;
      but all the time he had before his eyes the slender English letters traced
      by a little hand which he had so often and so ardently pressed to his
      heart.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. CAFE CHANTANT
    </h2>
    <p>
      What a rare, what a conscientious clerk did that new employe of the house
      of Fromont prove himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day his lamp was the first to appear at, and the last to disappear
      from, the windows of the factory. A little room had been arranged for him
      under the eaves, exactly like the one he had formerly occupied with
      Frantz, a veritable Trappist&rsquo;s cell, furnished with an iron cot and a
      white wooden table, that stood under his brother&rsquo;s portrait. He led the
      same busy, regular, quiet life as in those old days.
    </p>
    <p>
      He worked constantly, and had his meals brought from the same little
      creamery. But, alas! the disappearance forever of youth and hope deprived
      those memories of all their charm. Luckily he still had Frantz and Madame
      &ldquo;Chorche,&rdquo; the only two human beings of whom he could think without a
      feeling of sadness. Madame &ldquo;Chorche&rdquo; was always at hand, always trying to
      minister to his comfort, to console him; and Frantz wrote to him often,
      without mentioning Sidonie, by the way. Risler supposed that some one had
      told Frantz of the disaster that had befallen him, and he too avoided all
      allusion to the subject in his letters. &ldquo;Oh! when I can send for him to
      come home!&rdquo; That was his dream, his sole ambition: to restore the factory
      and recall his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the days succeeded one another, always the same to him in the
      restless activity of business and the heartrending loneliness of his
      grief. Every morning he walked through the workshops, where the profound
      respect he inspired and his stern, silent countenance had reestablished
      the orderly conditions that had been temporarily disturbed. In the
      beginning there had been much gossip, and various explanations of
      Sidonie&rsquo;s departure had been made. Some said that she had eloped with a
      lover, others that Risler had turned her out. The one fact that upset all
      conjectures was the attitude of the two partners toward each other,
      apparently as unconstrained as before. Sometimes, however, when they were
      talking together in the office, with no one by, Risler would suddenly
      start convulsively, as a vision of the crime passed before his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he would feel a mad longing to spring upon the villain, seize him by
      the throat, strangle him without mercy; but the thought of Madame
      &ldquo;Chorche&rdquo; was always there to restrain him. Should he be less courageous,
      less master of himself than that young wife? Neither Claire, nor Fromont,
      nor anybody else suspected what was in his mind. They could barely detect
      a severity, an inflexibility in his conduct, which were not habitual with
      him. Risler awed the workmen now; and those of them upon whom his white
      hair, blanched in one night, his drawn, prematurely old features did not
      impose respect, quailed before his strange glance-a glance from eyes of a
      bluish-black like the color of a gun-barrel. Whereas he had always been
      very kind and affable with the workmen, he had become pitilessly severe in
      regard to the slightest infraction of the rules. It seemed as if he were
      taking vengeance upon himself for some indulgence in the past, blind,
      culpable indulgence, for which he blamed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely he was a marvellous employe, was this new officer in the house of
      Fromont.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to him, the factory bell, notwithstanding the quavering of its old,
      cracked voice, had very soon resumed its authority; and the man who guided
      the whole establishment denied himself the slightest recreation. Sober as
      an apprentice, he left three-fourths of his salary with Planus for the
      Chebes&rsquo; allowance, but he never asked any questions about them. Punctually
      on the last day of the month the little man appeared to collect his little
      income, stiff and formal in his dealings with Sigismond, as became an
      annuitant on duty. Madame Chebe had tried to obtain an interview with her
      son-in-law, whom she pitied and loved; but the mere appearance of her
      palm-leaf shawl on the steps put Sidonie&rsquo;s husband to flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, the courage with which he armed himself was more apparent than
      real. The memory of his wife never left him. What had become of her? What
      was she doing? He was almost angry with Planus for never mentioning her.
      That letter, above all things, that letter which he had had the courage
      not to open, disturbed him. He thought of it continually. Ah! had he
      dared, how he would have liked to ask Sigismond for it!
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the temptation was too strong. He was alone in the office. The old
      cashier had gone out to luncheon, leaving the key in his drawer, a most
      extraordinary thing. Risler could not resist. He opened the drawer, moved
      the papers, and searched for his letter. It was not there. Sigismond must
      have put it away even more carefully, perhaps with a foreboding of what
      actually happened. In his heart Risler was not sorry for his
      disappointment; for he well knew that, had he found the letter, it would
      have been the end of the resigned and busy life which he imposed upon
      himself with so much difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the week it was all very well. Life was endurable, absorbed by the
      innumerable duties of the factory, and so fatiguing that, when night came,
      Risler fell on his bed like a lifeless mass. But Sunday was long and sad.
      The silence of the deserted yards and workshops opened a far wider field
      to his thoughts. He tried to busy himself, but he missed the encouragement
      of the others&rsquo; work. He alone was busy in that great, empty factory whose
      very breath was arrested. The locked doors, the closed blinds, the hoarse
      voice of Pere Achille playing with his dog in the deserted courtyard, all
      spoke of solitude. And the whole neighborhood also produced the same
      effect. In the streets, which seemed wider because of their emptiness, and
      where the passers-by were few and silent, the bells ringing for vespers
      had a melancholy sound, and sometimes an echo of the din of Paris,
      rumbling wheels, a belated hand-organ, the click of a toy-peddler&rsquo;s
      clappers, broke the silence, as if to make it even more noticeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler would try to invent new combinations of flowers and leaves, and,
      while he handled his pencil, his thoughts, not finding sufficient food
      there, would escape him, would fly back to his past happiness, to his
      hopeless misfortunes, would suffer martyrdom, and then, on returning,
      would ask the poor somnambulist, still seated at his table: &ldquo;What have you
      done in my absence?&rdquo; Alas! he had done nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! the long, heartbreaking, cruel Sundays! Consider that, mingled with
      all these perplexities in his mind, was the superstitious reverence of the
      common people for holy days, for the twenty-four hours of rest, wherein
      one recovers strength and courage. If he had gone out, the sight of a
      workingman with his wife and child would have made him weep, but his
      monastic seclusion gave him other forms of suffering, the despair of
      recluses, their terrible outbreaks of rebellion when the god to whom they
      have consecrated themselves does not respond to their sacrifices. Now,
      Risler&rsquo;s god was work, and as he no longer found comfort or serenity
      therein, he no longer believed in it, but cursed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often in those hours of mental struggle the door of the draughting-room
      would open gently and Claire Fromont would appear. The poor man&rsquo;s
      loneliness throughout those long Sunday afternoons filled her with
      compassion, and she would come with her little girl to keep him company,
      knowing by experience how contagious is the sweet joyousness of children.
      The little one, who could now walk alone, would slip from her mother&rsquo;s
      arms to run to her friend. Risler would hear the little, hurrying steps.
      He would feel the light breath behind him, and instantly he would be
      conscious of a soothing, rejuvenating influence. She would throw her plump
      little arms around his neck with affectionate warmth, with her artless,
      causeless laugh, and a kiss from that little mouth which never had lied.
      Claire Fromont, standing in the doorway, would smile as she looked at
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Risler, my friend,&rdquo; she would say, &ldquo;you must come down into the garden a
      while,&mdash;you work too hard. You will be ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Madame,&mdash;on the contrary, work is what saves me. It keeps me
      from thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, after a long pause, she would continue:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my dear Risler, you must try to forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Risler would shake his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget? Is that possible? There are some things beyond one&rsquo;s strength. A
      man may forgive, but he never forgets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child almost always succeeded in dragging him down to the garden. He
      must play ball, or in the sand, with her; but her playfellow&rsquo;s awkwardness
      and lack of enthusiasm soon impressed the little girl. Then she would
      become very sedate, contenting herself with walking gravely between the
      hedges of box, with her hand in her friend&rsquo;s. After a moment Risler would
      entirely forget that she was there; but, although he did not realize it,
      the warmth of that little hand in his had a magnetic, softening effect
      upon his diseased mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man may forgive, but he never forgets!
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Claire herself knew something about it; for she had never forgotten,
      notwithstanding her great courage and the conception she had formed of her
      duty. To her, as to Risler; her surroundings were a constant reminder of
      her sufferings. The objects amid which she lived pitilessly reopened the
      wound that was ready to close. The staircase, the garden, the courtyard,
      all those dumb witnesses of her husband&rsquo;s sin, assumed on certain days an
      implacable expression. Even the careful precaution her husband took to
      spare her painful reminders, the way in which he called attention to the
      fact that he no longer went out in the evening, and took pains to tell her
      where he had been during the day, served only to remind her the more
      forcibly of his wrong-doing. Sometimes she longed to ask him to forbear,&mdash;to
      say to him: &ldquo;Do not protest too much.&rdquo; Faith was shattered within her, and
      the horrible agony of the priest who doubts, and seeks at the same time to
      remain faithful to his vows, betrayed itself in her bitter smile, her
      cold, uncomplaining gentleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georges was wofully unhappy. He loved his wife now. The nobility of her
      character had conquered him. There was admiration in his love, and&mdash;why
      not say it?&mdash;Claire&rsquo;s sorrow filled the place of the coquetry which
      was contrary to her nature, the lack of which had always been a defect in
      her husband&rsquo;s eyes. He was one of that strange type of men who love to
      make conquests. Sidonie, capricious and cold as she was, responded to that
      whim of his heart. After parting from her with a tender farewell, he found
      her indifferent and forgetful the next day, and that continual need of
      wooing her back to him took the place of genuine passion. Serenity in love
      bored him as a voyage without storms wearies a sailor. On this occasion he
      had been very near shipwreck with his wife, and the danger had not passed
      even yet. He knew that Claire was alienated from him and devoted entirely
      to the child, the only link between them thenceforth. Their separation
      made her seem lovelier, more desirable, and he exercised all his powers of
      fascination to recapture her. He knew how hard a task it would be, and
      that he had no ordinary, frivolous nature to deal with. But he did not
      despair. Sometimes a vague gleam in the depths of the mild and apparently
      impassive glance with which she watched his efforts, bade him hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Sidonie, he no longer thought of her. Let no one be astonished at
      that abrupt mental rupture. Those two superficial beings had nothing to
      attach them securely to each other. Georges was incapable of receiving
      lasting impressions unless they were continually renewed; Sidonie, for her
      part, had no power to inspire any noble or durable sentiment. It was one
      of those intrigues between a cocotte and a coxcomb, compounded of vanity
      and of wounded self-love, which inspire neither devotion nor constancy,
      but tragic adventures, duels, suicides which are rarely fatal, and which
      end in a radical cure. Perhaps, had he seen her again, he might have had a
      relapse of his disease; but the impetus of flight had carried Sidonie away
      so swiftly and so far that her return was impossible. At all events, it
      was a relief for him to be able to live without lying; and the new life he
      was leading, a life of hard work and self-denial, with the goal of success
      in the distance, was not distasteful to him. Luckily; for the courage and
      determination of both partners were none too much to put the house on its
      feet once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor house of Fromont had sprung leaks on all sides. So Pere Planus
      still had wretched nights, haunted by the nightmare of notes maturing and
      the ominous vision of the little blue man. But, by strict economy, they
      always succeeded in paying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon four Risler Presses were definitively set up and used in the work of
      the factory. People began to take a deep interest in them and in the
      wall-paper trade. Lyons, Caen, Rixbeim, the great centres of the industry,
      were much disturbed concerning that marvellous &ldquo;rotary and dodecagonal&rdquo;
       machine. One fine day the Prochassons appeared, and offered three hundred
      thousand francs simply for an interest in the patent rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; Fromont Jeune asked Risler Aine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter shrugged his shoulders indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decide for yourself. It doesn&rsquo;t concern me. I am only an employe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words, spoken coldly, without anger, fell heavily upon Fromont&rsquo;s
      bewildered joy, and reminded him of the gravity of a situation which he
      was always on the point of forgetting.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he was alone with his dear Madame &ldquo;Chorche,&rdquo; Risler advised her
      not to accept the Prochassons&rsquo; offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&mdash;don&rsquo;t be in a hurry. Later you will have a better offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke only of them in that affair in which his own share was so
      glorious. She felt that he was preparing to cut himself adrift from their
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile orders came pouring in and accumulated on their hands. The
      quality of the paper, the reduced price because of the improved methods of
      manufacture, made competition impossible. There was no doubt that a
      colossal fortune was in store for the house of Fromont. The factory had
      resumed its former flourishing aspect and its loud, business-like hum.
      Intensely alive were all the great buildings and the hundreds of workmen
      who filled them. Pere Planus never raised his nose from his desk; one
      could see him from the little garden, leaning over his great ledgers,
      jotting down in magnificently molded figures the profits of the Risler
      press.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler still worked as before, without change or rest. The return of
      prosperity brought no alteration in his secluded habits, and from the
      highest window on the topmost floor of the house he listened to the
      ceaseless roar of his machines. He was no less gloomy, no less silent. One
      day, however, it became known at the factory that the press, a specimen of
      which had been sent to the great Exposition at Manchester, had received
      the gold medal, whereby its success was definitely established. Madame
      Georges called Risler into the garden at the luncheon hour, wishing to be
      the first to tell him the good news.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment a proud smile relaxed his prematurely old, gloomy features.
      His inventor&rsquo;s vanity, his pride in his renown, above all, the idea of
      repairing thus magnificently the wrong done to the family by his wife,
      gave him a moment of true happiness. He pressed Claire&rsquo;s hands and
      murmured, as in the old days:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very happy! I am very happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But what a difference in tone! He said it without enthusiasm, hopelessly,
      with the satisfaction of a task accomplished, and nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell rang for the workmen to return, and Risler went calmly upstairs
      to resume his work as on other days.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment he came down again. In spite of all, that news had excited him
      more than he cared to show. He wandered about the garden, prowled around
      the counting-room, smiling sadly at Pere Planus through the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ails him?&rdquo; the old cashier wondered. &ldquo;What does he want of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last, when night came and it was time to close the office, Risler
      summoned courage to go and speak to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Planus, my old friend, I should like&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like you to give me the&mdash;letter, you know, the little
      letter and the package.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sigismond stared at him in amazement. In his innocence, he had imagined
      that Risler never thought of Sidonie, that he had entirely forgotten her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;you want&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I have well earned it; I can think of myself a little now. I have
      thought enough of others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Planus. &ldquo;Well, this is what we&rsquo;ll do. The letter and
      package are at my house at Montrouge. If you choose, we will go and dine
      together at the Palais-Royal, as in the good old times. I will stand
      treat. We&rsquo;ll water your medal with a bottle of wine; something choice!
      Then we&rsquo;ll go to the house together. You can get your trinkets, and if
      it&rsquo;s too late for you to go home, Mademoiselle Planus, my sister, shall
      make up a bed for you, and you shall pass the night with us. We are very
      comfortable there&mdash;it&rsquo;s in the country. To-morrow morning at seven
      o&rsquo;clock we&rsquo;ll come back to the factory by the first omnibus. Come, old
      fellow, give me this pleasure. If you don&rsquo;t, I shall think you still bear
      your old Sigismond a grudge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Risler accepted. He cared little about celebrating the award of his medal,
      but he desired to gain a few hours before opening the little letter he had
      at last earned the right to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must dress. That was quite a serious matter, for he had lived in a
      workman&rsquo;s jacket during the past six months. And what an event in the
      factory! Madame Fromont was informed at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, Madame! Monsieur Risler is going out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Claire looked at him from her window, and that tall form, bowed by sorrow,
      leaning on Sigismond&rsquo;s arm, aroused in her a profound, unusual emotion
      which she remembered ever after.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the street people bowed to Risler with great interest. Even their
      greetings warmed his heart. He was so much in need of kindness! But the
      noise of vehicles made him a little dizzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My head is spinning,&rdquo; he said to Planus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lean hard on me, old fellow-don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And honest Planus drew himself up, escorting his friend with the artless,
      unconventional pride of a peasant of the South bearing aloft his village
      saint.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they arrived at the Palais-Royal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The garden was full of people. They had come to hear the music, and were
      trying to find seats amid clouds of dust and the scraping of chairs. The
      two friends hurried into the restaurant to avoid all that turmoil. They
      established themselves in one of the large salons on the first floor,
      whence they could see the green trees, the promenaders, and the water
      spurting from the fountain between the two melancholy flower-gardens. To
      Sigismond it was the ideal of luxury, that restaurant, with gilding
      everywhere, around the mirrors, in the chandelier and even on the figured
      wallpaper. The white napkin, the roll, the menu of a table d&rsquo;hote dinner
      filled his soul with joy. &ldquo;We are comfortable here, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; he said to
      Risler.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he exclaimed at each of the courses of that banquet at two francs
      fifty, and insisted on filling his friend&rsquo;s plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eat that&mdash;it&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other, notwithstanding his desire to do honor to the fete, seemed
      preoccupied and gazed out-of-doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember, Sigismond?&rdquo; he said, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old cashier, engrossed in his memories of long ago, of Risler&rsquo;s first
      employment at the factory, replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think I do remember&mdash;listen! The first time we dined
      together at the Palais-Royal was in February, &lsquo;forty-six, the year we put
      in the planches-plates at the factory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Risler shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no&mdash;I mean three years ago. It was in that room just opposite
      that we dined on that memorable evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he pointed to the great windows of the salon of Cafe Vefour, gleaming
      in the rays of the setting sun like the chandeliers at a wedding feast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! yes, true,&rdquo; murmured Sigismond, abashed. What an unlucky idea of his
      to bring his friend to a place that recalled such painful things!
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler, not wishing to cast a gloom upon their banquet, abruptly raised
      his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! here&rsquo;s your health, my old comrade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to change the subject. But a moment later he himself led the
      conversation back to it again, and asked Sigismond, in an undertone, as if
      he were ashamed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wife? No, never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t written again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;never again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must have heard of her. What has she been doing these six months?
      Does she live with her parents?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Risler turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hoped that Sidonie would have returned to her mother, that she would
      have worked, as he had worked, to forget and atone. He had often thought
      that he would arrange his life according to what he should learn of her
      when he should have the right to speak of her; and in one of those far-off
      visions of the future, which have the vagueness of a dream, he sometimes
      fancied himself living in exile with the Chebes in an unknown land, where
      nothing would remind him of his past shame. It was not a definite plan, to
      be sure; but the thought lived in the depths of his mind like a hope,
      caused by the need that all human creatures feel of finding their lost
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she in Paris?&rdquo; he asked, after a few moments&rsquo; reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. She went away three months ago. No one knows where she has gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sigismond did not add that she had gone with her Cazaboni, whose name she
      now bore, that they were making the circuit of the provincial cities
      together, that her mother was in despair, never saw her, and heard of her
      only through Delobelle. Sigismond did not deem it his duty to mention all
      that, and after his last words he held his peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler, for his part, dared ask no further questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they sat there, facing each other, both embarrassed by the long
      silence, the military band began to play under the trees in the garden.
      They played one of those Italian operatic overtures which seem to have
      been written expressly for public open-air resorts; the swiftly-flowing
      notes, as they rise into the air, blend with the call of the swallows and
      the silvery plash of the fountain. The blaring brass brings out in bold
      relief the mild warmth of the closing hours of those summer days, so long
      and enervating in Paris; it seems as if one could hear nothing else. The
      distant rumbling of wheels, the cries of children playing, the footsteps
      of the promenaders are wafted away in those resonant, gushing, refreshing
      waves of melody, as useful to the people of Paris as the daily watering of
      their streets. On all sides the faded flowers, the trees white with dust,
      the faces made pale and wan by the heat, all the sorrows, all the miseries
      of a great city, sitting dreamily, with bowed head, on the benches in the
      garden, feel its comforting, refreshing influence. The air is stirred,
      renewed by those strains that traverse it, filling it with harmony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Risler felt as if the tension upon all his nerves were relaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little music does one good,&rdquo; he said, with glistening eyes. &ldquo;My heart
      is heavy, old fellow,&rdquo; he added, in a lower tone; &ldquo;if you knew&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat without speaking, their elbows resting on the window-sill, while
      their coffee was served.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the music ceased, the garden became deserted. The light that had
      loitered in the corners crept upward to the roofs, cast its last rays upon
      the highest windowpanes, followed by the birds, the swallows, which
      saluted the close of day with a farewell chirp from the gutter where they
      were huddled together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, where shall we go?&rdquo; said Planus, as they left the restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wherever you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the first floor of a building on the Rue Montpensier, close at hand,
      was a cafe chantant, where many people entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we go in,&rdquo; said Planus, desirous of banishing his friend&rsquo;s
      melancholy at any cost, &ldquo;the beer is excellent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Risler assented to the suggestion; he had not tasted beer for six months.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a former restaurant transformed into a concert-hall. There were
      three large rooms, separated by gilded pillars, the partitions having been
      removed; the decoration was in the Moorish style, bright red, pale blue,
      with little crescents and turbans for ornament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although it was still early, the place was full; and even before entering
      one had a feeling of suffocation, simply from seeing the crowds of people
      sitting around the tables, and at the farther end, half-hidden by the rows
      of pillars, a group of white-robed women on a raised platform, in the heat
      and glare of the gas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our two friends had much difficulty in finding seats, and had to be
      content with a place behind a pillar whence they could see only half of
      the platform, then occupied by a superb person in black coat and yellow
      gloves, curled and waxed and oiled, who was singing in a vibrating voice&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          Mes beaux lions aux crins dores,
          Du sang des troupeaux alteres,
          Halte la!&mdash;Je fais sentinello!

          [My proud lions with golden manes
          Who thirst for the blood of my flocks,
          Stand back!&mdash;I am on guard!]
</pre>
    <p>
      The audience&mdash;small tradesmen of the quarter with their wives and
      daughters-seemed highly enthusiastic: especially the women. He represented
      so perfectly the ideal of the shopkeeper imagination, that magnificent
      shepherd of the desert, who addressed lions with such an air of authority
      and tended his flocks in full evening dress. And so, despite their
      bourgeois bearing, their modest costumes and their expressionless
      shop-girl smiles, all those women, made up their little mouths to be
      caught by the hook of sentiment, and cast languishing glances upon the
      singer. It was truly comical to see that glance at the platform suddenly
      change and become contemptuous and fierce as it fell upon the husband, the
      poor husband tranquilly drinking a glass of beer opposite his wife: &ldquo;You
      would never be capable of doing sentry duty in the very teeth of lions,
      and in a black coat too, and with yellow gloves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the husband&rsquo;s eye seemed to reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! &lsquo;dame&rsquo;, yes, he&rsquo;s quite a dashing buck, that fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Being decidedly indifferent to heroism of that stamp, Risler and Sigismond
      were drinking their beer without paying much attention to the music, when,
      at the end of the song, amid the applause and cries and uproar that
      followed it, Pere Planus uttered an exclamation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that is odd; one would say&mdash;but no, I&rsquo;m not mistaken. It is he,
      it&rsquo;s Delobelle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was, in fact, the illustrious actor, whom he had discovered in the
      front row near the platform. His gray head was turned partly away from
      them. He was leaning carelessly against a pillar, hat in hand, in his
      grand make-up as leading man: dazzlingly white linen, hair curled with the
      tongs, black coat with a camellia in the buttonhole, like the ribbon of an
      order. He glanced at the crowd from time to time with a patronizing air:
      but his eyes were most frequently turned toward the platform, with
      encouraging little gestures and smiles and pretended applause, addressed
      to some one whom Pere Planus could not see from his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing very extraordinary in the presence of the illustrious
      Delobelle at a cafe concert, as he spent all his evenings away from home;
      and yet the old cashier felt vaguely disturbed, especially when he
      discovered in the same row a blue cape and a pair of steely eyes. It was
      Madame Dobson, the sentimental singing-teacher. The conjunction of those
      two faces amid the pipe-smoke and the confusion of the crowd, produced
      upon Sigismond the effect of two ghosts evoked by a bad dream. He was
      afraid for his friend, without knowing exactly why; and suddenly it
      occurred to him to take him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go, Risler. The heat here is enough to kill one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just as they rose&mdash;for Risler was no more desirous to stay than to go&mdash;the
      orchestra, consisting of a piano and several violins, began a peculiar
      refrain. There was a flutter of curiosity throughout the room, and cries
      of &ldquo;Hush! hush! sit down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were obliged to resume their seats. Risler, too, was beginning to be
      disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that tune,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Where have I heard it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A thunder of applause and an exclamation from Planus made him raise his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, let us go,&rdquo; said the cashier, trying to lead him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler had already seen his wife come forward to the front of the stage
      and curtsey to the audience with a ballet-dancer&rsquo;s smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wore a white gown, as on the night of the ball; but her whole costume
      was much less rich and shockingly immodest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dress was barely caught together at the shoulders; her hair floated in
      a blond mist low over her eyes, and around her neck was a necklace of
      pearls too large to be real, alternated with bits of tinsel. Delobelle was
      right: the Bohemian life was better suited to her. Her beauty had gained
      an indefinably reckless expression, which was its most characteristic
      feature, and made her a perfect type of the woman who has escaped from all
      restraint, placed herself at the mercy of every accident, and is
      descending stage by stage to the lowest depths of the Parisian hell, from
      which nothing is powerful enough to lift her and restore her to the pure
      air and the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      And how perfectly at ease she seemed in her strolling life! With what
      self-possession she walked to the front of the stage! Ah! could she have
      seen the desperate, terrible glance fixed upon her down there in the hall,
      concealed behind a pillar, her smile would have lost that equivocal
      placidity, her voice would have sought in vain those wheedling, languorous
      tones in which she warbled the only song Madame Dobson had ever been able
      to teach her:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          Pauv&rsquo; pitit Mamz&rsquo;elle Zizi,
          C&rsquo;est l&rsquo;amou, l&rsquo;amou qui tourne
          La tete a li.
</pre>
    <p>
      Risler had risen, in spite of Planus&rsquo;s efforts. &ldquo;Sit down! sit down!&rdquo; the
      people shouted. The wretched man heard nothing. He was staring at his
      wife.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          C&rsquo;est l&rsquo;amou, l&rsquo;amou qui tourne
          La tete a li,
</pre>
    <p>
      Sidonie repeated affectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he wondered whether he should not leap on the platform and
      kill her. Red flames shot before his eyes, and he was blinded with frenzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, suddenly, shame and disgust seized upon him and he rushed from the
      hall, overturning chairs and tables, pursued by the terror and
      imprecations of all those scandalized bourgeois.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. SIDONIE&rsquo;S VENGEANCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Never had Sigismond Planus returned home so late without giving his sister
      warning, during the twenty years and more that he had lived at Montrouge.
      Consequently Mademoiselle Planus was greatly worried. Living in community
      of ideas and of everything else with her brother, having but one mind for
      herself and for him, the old maid had felt for several months the rebound
      of all the cashier&rsquo;s anxiety and indignation; and the effect was still
      noticeable in her tendency to tremble and become agitated on slight
      provocation. At the slightest tardiness on Sigismond&rsquo;s part, she would
      think:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! mon Dieu! If only nothing has happened at the factory!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That is the reason why on the evening in question, when the hens and
      chickens were all asleep on their perches, and the dinner had been removed
      untouched, Mademoiselle Planus was sitting in the little ground-floor
      living-room, waiting, in great agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, about eleven o&rsquo;clock, some one rang. A timid, melancholy ring, in
      no wise resembling Sigismond&rsquo;s vigorous pull.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you, Monsieur Planus?&rdquo; queried the old lady from behind the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was he; but he was not alone. A tall, bent old man accompanied him,
      and, as they entered, bade her good-evening in a slow, hesitating voice.
      Not till then did Mademoiselle Planus recognize Risler Aine, whom she had
      not seen since the days of the New Year&rsquo;s calls, that is to say, some time
      before the dramas at the factory. She could hardly restrain an exclamation
      of pity; but the grave taciturnity of the two men told her that she must
      be silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Planus, my sister, you will put clean sheets on my bed. Our
      friend Risler does us the honor to pass the night with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sister hastened away to prepare the bedroom with an almost
      affectionate zeal; for, as we know, beside &ldquo;Monsieur Planus, my brother,&rdquo;
       Risler was the only man excepted from the general reprobation in which she
      enveloped the whole male sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon leaving the cafe concert, Sidonie&rsquo;s husband had had a moment of
      frantic excitement. He leaned on Planus&rsquo;s arm, every nerve in his body
      strained to the utmost. At that moment he had no thought of going to
      Montrouge to get the letter and the package.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me&mdash;go away,&rdquo; he said to Sigismond. &ldquo;I must be alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the other knew better than to abandon him thus to his despair.
      Unnoticed by Risler, he led him away from the factory, and as his
      affectionate heart suggested to the old cashier what he had best say to
      his friend, he talked to him all the time of Frantz, his little Frantz
      whom he loved so dearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was genuine affection, genuine and trustworthy. No treachery to fear
      with such hearts as that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While they talked they left behind them the noisy streets of the centre of
      Paris. They walked along the quays, skirted the Jardin des Plantes,
      plunged into Faubourg Saint-Marceau. Risler followed where the other led.
      Sigismond&rsquo;s words did him so much good!
    </p>
    <p>
      In due time they came to the Bievre, bordered at that point with tanneries
      whose tall drying-houses with open sides were outlined in blue against the
      sky; and then the ill-defined plains of Montsouris, vast tracts of land
      scorched and stripped of vegetation by the fiery breath that Paris exhales
      around its daily toil, like a monstrous dragon, whose breath of flame and
      smoke suffers no vegetation within its range.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Montsouris to the fortifications of Montrouge is but a step. When
      they had reached that point, Planus had no great difficulty in taking his
      friend home with him. He thought, and justly, that his tranquil fireside,
      the spectacle of a placid, fraternal, devoted affection, would give the
      wretched man&rsquo;s heart a sort of foretaste of the happiness that was in
      store for him with his brother Frantz. And, in truth, the charm of the
      little household began to work as soon as they arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, you are right, old fellow,&rdquo; said Risler, pacing the floor of
      the living-room, &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t think of that woman any more. She&rsquo;s like a
      dead woman to me now. I have nobody left in the world but my little
      Frantz; I don&rsquo;t know yet whether I shall send for him to come home, or go
      out and join him; the one thing that is certain is that we are going to
      stay together. Ah! I longed so to have a son! Now I have found one. I want
      no other. When I think that for a moment I had an idea of killing myself!
      Nonsense! it would make Madame What-d&rsquo;ye-call-her, yonder, too happy. On
      the contrary, I mean to live&mdash;to live with my Frantz, and for him,
      and for nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; said Sigismond, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the way I like to hear you talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Mademoiselle Planus came to say that the room was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler apologized for the trouble he was causing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are so comfortable, so happy here. Really, it&rsquo;s too bad to burden you
      with my melancholy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my old friend, you can arrange just such happiness as ours for
      yourself,&rdquo; said honest Sigismond with beaming face. &ldquo;I have my sister, you
      have your brother. What do we lack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Risler smiled vaguely. He fancied himself already installed with Frantz in
      a quiet little quakerish house like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decidedly, that was an excellent idea of Pere Planus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to bed,&rdquo; he said triumphantly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go and show you your room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sigismond Planus&rsquo;s bedroom was on the ground floor, a large room simply
      but neatly furnished; with muslin curtains at the windows and the bed, and
      little squares of carpet on the polished floor, in front of the chairs.
      The dowager Madame Fromont herself could have found nothing to say as to
      the orderly and cleanly aspect of the place. On a shelf or two against the
      wall were a few books: Manual of Fishing, The Perfect Country Housewife,
      Bayeme&rsquo;s Book-keeping. That was the whole of the intellectual equipment of
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pere Planus glanced proudly around. The glass of water was in its place on
      the walnut table, the box of razors on the dressing-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Risler. Here is everything you need. And if you should want
      anything else, the keys are in all the drawers&mdash;you have only to turn
      them. Just see what a beautiful view you get from here. It&rsquo;s a little dark
      just now, but when you wake up in the morning you&rsquo;ll see; it is
      magnificent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the widow. Great drops of rain were beginning to fall, and
      lightning flashes rending the darkness disclosed the long, silent line of
      the fortifications, with telegraph poles at intervals, or the frowning
      door of a casemate. Now and then the footsteps of a patrol making the
      rounds, the clash of muskets or swords, reminded them that they were
      within the military zone.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the outlook so vaunted by Planus&mdash;a melancholy outlook if
      ever there were one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now good-night. Sleep well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, as the old cashier was leaving the room, his friend called him back:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sigismond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; said Sigismond, and he waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler blushed slightly and moved his lips like a man who is about to
      speak; then, with a mighty effort, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no-nothing. Good-night, old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the dining-room the brother and sister talked together a long while in
      low tones. Planus described the terrible occurrence of the evening, the
      meeting with Sidonie; and you can imagine the&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! these women!&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Oh! these men?&rdquo; At last, when they had locked the little garden-door,
      Mademoiselle Planus went up to her room, and Sigismond made himself as
      comfortable as possible in a small cabinet adjoining.
    </p>
    <p>
      About midnight the cashier was aroused by his sister calling him in a
      terrified whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Planus, my brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it was awful. Something like a deep sigh, but so loud and so sad! It
      came from the room below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They listened. Without, the rain was falling in torrents, with the dreary
      rustling of leaves that makes the country seem so lonely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is only the wind,&rdquo; said Planus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure not. Hush! Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amid the tumult of the storm, they heard a wailing sound, like a sob, in
      which a name was pronounced with difficulty:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frantz! Frantz!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was terrible and pitiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Christ on the Cross sent up to heaven His despairing cry: &lsquo;Eli, eli,
      lama sabachthani&rsquo;, they who heard him must have felt the same species of
      superstitious terror that suddenly seized upon Mademoiselle Planus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid!&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;suppose you go and look&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, we will let him alone. He is thinking of his brother. Poor
      fellow! It&rsquo;s the very thought of all others that will do him the most
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the old cashier went to sleep again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning he woke as usual when the drums beat the reveille in the
      fortifications; for the little family, surrounded by barracks, regulated
      its life by the military calls. The sister had already risen and was
      feeding the poultry. When she saw Sigismond she came to him in agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very strange,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I hear nothing stirring in Monsieur
      Risler&rsquo;s room. But the window is wide open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sigismond, greatly surprised, went and knocked at his friend&rsquo;s door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Risler! Risler!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He called in great anxiety:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Risler, are you there? Are you asleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no reply. He opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was cold. It was evident that the damp air had been blowing in
      all night through the open window. At the first glance at the bed,
      Sigismond thought: &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t been in bed&rdquo;&mdash;for the clothes were
      undisturbed and the condition of the room, even in the most trivial
      details, revealed an agitated vigil: the still smoking lamp, which he had
      neglected to extinguish, the carafe, drained to the last drop by the fever
      of sleeplessness; but the thing that filled the cashier with dismay was to
      find the bureau drawer wide open in which he had carefully bestowed the
      letter and package entrusted to him by his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was no longer there. The package lay on the table, open,
      revealing a photograph of Sidonie at fifteen. With her high-necked frock,
      her rebellious hair parted over the forehead, and the embarrassed pose of
      an awkward girl, the little Chebe of the old days, Mademoiselle Le Mire&rsquo;s
      apprentice, bore little resemblance to the Sidonie of to-day. And that was
      the reason why Risler had kept that photograph, as a souvenir, not of his
      wife, but of the &ldquo;little one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sigismond was in great dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my fault,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I ought to have taken away the
      keys. But who would have supposed that he was still thinking of her? He
      had sworn so many times that that woman no longer existed for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Mademoiselle Planus entered the room with consternation
      written on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Risler has gone!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone? Why, wasn&rsquo;t the garden-gate locked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have climbed over the wall. You can see his footprints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other, terrified beyond measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the letter!&rdquo; thought Planus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently that letter from his wife must have made some extraordinary
      revelation to Risler; and, in order not to disturb his hosts, he had made
      his escape noiselessly through the window, like a burglar. Why? With what
      aim in view?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see, sister,&rdquo; said poor Planus, as he dressed with all haste,
      &ldquo;you will see that that hussy has played him still another trick.&rdquo; And
      when his sister tried to encourage him, he recurred to his favorite
      refrain:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haf no gonfidence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he was dressed, he darted out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler&rsquo;s footprints could be distinguished on the wet ground as far as the
      gate of the little garden. He must have gone before daylight, for the beds
      of vegetables and flowers were trampled down at random by deep footprints
      with long spaces between; there were marks of heels on the garden-wall and
      the mortar was crumbled slightly on top. The brother and sister went out
      on the road skirting the fortifications. There it was impossible to follow
      the footprints. They could tell nothing more than that Risler had gone in
      the direction of the Orleans road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; Mademoiselle Planus ventured to say, &ldquo;we are very foolish to
      torment ourselves about him; perhaps he has simply gone back to the
      factory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sigismond shook his head. Ah! if he had said all that he thought!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Return to the house, sister. I will go and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with the old &ldquo;I haf no gonfidence&rdquo; he rushed away like a hurricane,
      his white mane standing even more erect than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that hour, on the road near the fortifications, was an endless
      procession of soldiers and market-gardeners, guard-mounting, officers&rsquo; 
      horses out for exercise, sutlers with their paraphernalia, all the bustle
      and activity that is seen in the morning in the neighborhood of forts.
      Planus was striding along amid the tumult, when suddenly he stopped. At
      the foot of the bank, on the left, in front of a small, square building,
      with the inscription.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
               CITY OF PARIS,
            ENTRANCE TO THE QUARRIES,
</pre>
    <p>
      On the rough plaster, he saw a crowd assembled, and soldiers&rsquo; and
      custom-house officers&rsquo; uniforms, mingled with the shabby, dirty blouses of
      barracks-loafers. The old man instinctively approached. A customs officer,
      seated on the stone step below a round postern with iron bars, was talking
      with many gestures, as if he were acting out his narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was where I am,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He had hanged himself sitting, by pulling
      with all his strength on the rope! It&rsquo;s clear that he had made up his mind
      to die, for he had a razor in his pocket that he would have used in case
      the rope had broken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A voice in the crowd exclaimed: &ldquo;Poor devil!&rdquo; Then another, a tremulous
      voice, choking with emotion, asked timidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it quite certain that he&rsquo;s dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody looked at Planus and began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s a greenhorn,&rdquo; said the officer. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I tell you that he
      was all blue this morning, when we cut him down to take him to the
      chasseurs&rsquo; barracks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The barracks were not far away; and yet Sigismond Planus had the greatest
      difficulty in the world in dragging himself so far. In vain did he say to
      himself that suicides are of frequent occurrence in Paris, especially in
      those regions; that not a day passes that a dead body is not found
      somewhere along that line of fortifications, as upon the shores of a
      tempestuous sea,&mdash;he could not escape the terrible presentiment that
      had oppressed his heart since early morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you have come to see the man that hanged himself,&rdquo; said the
      quartermaster-sergeant at the door of the barracks. &ldquo;See! there he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The body had been laid on a table supported by trestles in a sort of shed.
      A cavalry cloak that had been thrown over it covered it from head to foot,
      and fell in the shroud-like folds which all draperies assume that come in
      contact with the rigidity of death. A group of officers and several
      soldiers in duck trousers were looking on at a distance, whispering as if
      in a church; and an assistant-surgeon was writing a report of the death on
      a high window-ledge. To him Sigismond spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like very much to see him,&rdquo; he said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked to the table, hesitated a minute, then, summoning courage,
      uncovered a swollen face, a tall, motionless body in its rain-soaked
      garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has killed you at last, my old comrade!&rdquo; murmured Planus, and fell on
      his knees, sobbing bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officers had come forward, gazing curiously at the body, which was
      left uncovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, surgeon,&rdquo; said one of them. &ldquo;His hand is closed, as if he were
      holding something in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; the surgeon replied, drawing nearer. &ldquo;That sometimes
      happens in the last convulsions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember at Solferino, Commandant Bordy held his little daughter&rsquo;s
      miniature in his hand like that? We had much difficulty in taking it from
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he tried to open the poor, tightly-closed dead hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is a letter that he is holding so tight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was about to read it; but one of the officers took it from his hands
      and passed it to Sigismond, who was still kneeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Monsieur. Perhaps you will find in this some last wish to be
      carried out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sigismond Planus rose. As the light in the room was dim, he walked with
      faltering step to the window, and read, his eyes filled with tears:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, I love you, I love you, more than ever and forever! What is
      the use of struggling and fighting against fate? Our sin is stronger than
      we...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the letter which Frantz had written to his sister-in-law a year
      before, and which Sidonie had sent to her husband on the day following
      their terrible scene, to revenge herself on him and his brother at the
      same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Risler could have survived his wife&rsquo;s treachery, but that of his brother
      had killed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Sigismond understood, he was petrified with horror. He stood there,
      with the letter in his hand, gazing mechanically through the open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock struck six.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yonder, over Paris, whose dull roar they could hear although they could
      not see the city, a cloud of smoke arose, heavy and hot, moving slowly
      upward, with a fringe of red and black around its edges, like the
      powder-smoke on a field of battle. Little by little, steeples, white
      buildings, a gilded cupola, emerged from the mist, and burst forth in a
      splendid awakening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the thousands of tall factory chimneys, towering above that sea of
      clustered roofs, began with one accord to exhale their quivering vapor,
      with the energy of a steamer about to sail. Life was beginning anew.
      Forward, ye wheels of time! And so much the worse for him who lags behind!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon old Planus gave way to a terrible outburst of wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! harlot-harlot!&rdquo; he cried, shaking his fist; and no one could say
      whether he was addressing the woman or the city of Paris.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
