      TH. BENTZON
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is natural that the attention and affection of Americans should be
      attracted to a woman who has devoted herself assiduously to understanding
      and to making known the aspirations of our country, especially in
      introducing the labors and achievements of our women to their sisters in
      France, of whom we also have much to learn; for simple, homely virtues and
      the charm of womanliness may still be studied with advantage on the
      cherished soil of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marie-Therese Blanc, nee Solms&mdash;for this is the name of the author
      who writes under the nom de plume of Madame Bentzon&mdash;is considered
      the greatest of living French female novelists. She was born in an old
      French chateau at Seine-Porte (Seine et Oise), September 21, 1840. This
      chateau was owned by Madame Bentzon&rsquo;s grandmother, the Marquise de Vitry,
      who was a woman of great force and energy of character, &ldquo;a ministering
      angel&rdquo; to her country neighborhood. Her grandmother&rsquo;s first marriage was
      to a Dane, Major-General Adrien-Benjamin de Bentzon, a Governor of the
      Danish Antilles. By this marriage there was one daughter, the mother of
      Therese, who in turn married the Comte de Solms. &ldquo;This mixture of races,&rdquo;
       Madame Blanc once wrote, &ldquo;surely explains a kind of moral and intellectual
      cosmopolitanism which is found in my nature. My father of German descent,
      my mother of Danish&mdash;my nom de plume (which was her maiden-name) is
      Danish&mdash;with Protestant ancestors on her side, though she and I were
      Catholics&mdash;my grandmother a sound and witty Parisian, gay, brilliant,
      lively, with superb physical health and the consequent good spirits&mdash;surely
      these materials could not have produced other than a cosmopolitan being.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somehow or other, the family became impoverished. Therese de Solms took to
      writing stories. After many refusals, her debut took place in the &lsquo;Revue
      des Deux Mondes&rsquo;, and her perseverance was largely due to the
      encouragement she received from George Sand, although that great woman saw
      everything through the magnifying glass of her genius. But the person to
      whom Therese Bentzon was most indebted in the matter of literary advice&mdash;she
      says herself&mdash;was the late M. Caro, the famous Sorbonne professor of
      philosophy, himself an admirable writer, &ldquo;who put me through a course of
      literature, acting as my guide through a vast amount of solid reading, and
      criticizing my work with kindly severity.&rdquo; Success was slow. Strange as it
      may seem, there is a prejudice against female writers in France, a country
      that has produced so many admirable women-authors. However, the time was
      to come when M. Becloz found one of her stories in the &lsquo;Journal des
      Debats&rsquo;. It was the one entitled &lsquo;Un Divorce&rsquo;, and he lost no time in
      engaging the young writer to become one of his staff. From that day to
      this she has found the pages of the Revue always open to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Bentzon is a novelist, translator, and writer of literary essays.
      The list of her works runs as follows: &lsquo;Le Roman d&rsquo;un Muet (1868); Un
      Divorce (1872); La Grande Sauliere (1877); Un remords (1878); Yette and
      Georgette (1880); Le Retour (1882); Tete folle (1883); Tony, (1884);
      Emancipee (1887); Constance (1891); Jacqueline (1893). We need not enter
      into the merits of style and composition if we mention that &lsquo;Un remords,
      Tony, and Constance&rsquo; were crowned by the French Academy, and &lsquo;Jacqueline&rsquo; 
      in 1893. Madame Bentzon is likewise the translator of Aldrich, Bret Harte,
      Dickens, and Ouida. Some of her critical works are &lsquo;Litterature et Moeurs
      etrangeres&rsquo;, 1882, and &lsquo;Nouveaux romanciers americains&rsquo;, 1885.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. A PARISIENNE&rsquo;S &ldquo;AT HOME&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      Despite a short frock, checked stockings, wide turned-over collar, and a
      loose sash around the waist of her blouse in other words, despite the
      childish fashion of a dress which seemed to denote that she was not more
      than thirteen or fourteen years of age, she seemed much older. An observer
      would have put her down as the oldest of the young girls who on Tuesdays,
      at Madame de Nailles&rsquo;s afternoons, filled what was called &ldquo;the young
      girls&rsquo; corner&rdquo; with whispered merriment and low laughter, while, under
      pretence of drinking tea, the noise went on which is always audible when
      there is anything to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt the amber tint of this young girl&rsquo;s complexion, the raven
      blackness of her hair, her marked yet delicate features, and the general
      impression produced by her dark coloring, were reasons why she seemed
      older than the rest. It was Jacqueline&rsquo;s privilege to exhibit that style
      of beauty which comes earliest to perfection, and retains it longest; and,
      what was an equal privilege, she resembled no one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deep bow-window&mdash;her favorite spot&mdash;which enabled her to
      have a reception-day in connection with that of her mamma, seemed like a
      great basket of roses when all her friends assembled there, seated on low
      chairs in unstudied attitudes: the white rose of the group was
      Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Etaples, a specimen of pale and pensive beauty, frail
      almost to transparency; the Rose of Bengal was the charming Colette
      Odinska, a girl of Polish race, but born in Paris; the dark-red rose was
      Isabelle Ray-Belle she was called triumphantly&mdash;whose dimpled cheeks
      flushed scarlet for almost any cause, some said for very coquetry. Then
      there were three little girls called Wermant, daughters of an agent de
      change&mdash;a spray of May roses, exactly alike in features, manners, and
      dress, sprightly and charming as little girls could be. A little pompon
      rose was tiny Dorothee d&rsquo;Avrigny, to whom the pet name Dolly was
      appropriate, for never had any doll&rsquo;s waxen face been more lovely than her
      little round one, with its mouth shaped like a little heart&mdash;a mouth
      smaller than her eyes, and these were round eyes, too, but so bright, and
      blue, and soft, that it was easy to overlook their too frequently startled
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline had nothing in common with a rose of any kind, but she was not
      the less charming to look at. Such was the unspoken reflection of a man
      who was well able to be a judge in such matters. His name was Hubert
      Marien. He was a great painter, and was now watching the clear-cut,
      somewhat Arab&mdash;like profile of this girl&mdash;a profile brought out
      distinctly against the dark-red silk background of a screen, much as we
      see a cameo stand out in sharp relief from the glittering stone from which
      the artist has fashioned it. Marien looked at her from a distance, leaning
      against the fireplace of the farther salon, whence he could see plainly
      the corner shaded by green foliage plants where Jacqueline had made her
      niche, as she called it. The two rooms formed practically but one, being
      separated only by a large recess without folding-doors, or &lsquo;portires&rsquo;.
      Hubert Marien, from his place behind Madame de Nailles&rsquo;s chair, had often
      before watched Jacqueline as he was watching her at this moment. She had
      grown up, as it were, under his own eye. He had seen her playing with her
      dolls, absorbed in her story-books, and crunching sugar-plums, he had paid
      her visits&mdash;for how many years? He did not care to count them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And little girls bloom fast! How old they make us feel! Who would have
      supposed the most unpromising of little buds would have transformed itself
      so soon into what he gazed upon? Marien, as an artist, had great pleasure
      in studying the delicate outline of that graceful head surmounted by thick
      tresses, with rebellious ringlets rippling over the brow before they were
      gathered into the thick braid that hung behind; and Jacqueline, although
      she appeared to be wholly occupied with her guests, felt the gaze that was
      fixed upon her, and was conscious of its magnetic influence, from which
      nothing would have induced her to escape even had she been able. All the
      young girls were listening attentively (despite their more serious
      occupation of consuming dainties) to what was going on in the next room
      among the grown-up people, whose conversation reached them only in
      detached fragments.
    </p>
    <p>
      So long as the subject talked about was the last reception at the French
      Academy, these young girls (comrades in the class-room and at the weekly
      catechising) had been satisfied to discuss together their own little
      affairs, but after Colonel de Valdonjon began to talk complete silence
      reigned among them. One might have heard the buzzing of a fly. Their
      attention, however, was of little use. Exclamations of oh! and ah! and
      protests more or less sincere drowned even the loud and somewhat hoarse
      voice of the Colonel. The girls heard it only through a sort of general
      murmur, out of which a burst of astonishment or of dissent would
      occasionally break forth. These outbreaks were all the curious group could
      hear distinctly. They sniffed, as it were, at the forbidden fruit, but
      they longed to inhale the full perfume of the scandal that they felt was
      in the air. That stout officer of cuirassiers, of whom some people spoke
      as &ldquo;The Chatterbox,&rdquo; took advantage of his profession to tell many an
      unsavory story which he had picked up or invented at his club. He had come
      to Madame de Nailles&rsquo;s reception with a brand-new concoction of falsehood
      and truth, a story likely to be hawked round Paris with great success for
      several weeks to come, though ladies on first hearing it would think
      proper to cry out that they would not even listen to it, and would pretend
      to look round them for their fans to hide their confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal object of interest in this scandalous gossip was a valuable
      diamond bracelet, one of those priceless bits of jewelry seldom seen
      except in show-windows on the Rue de la Paix, intended to be bought only
      for presentation to princesses&mdash;of some sort or kind. Well, by an
      extraordinary, chance the Marquise de Versannes&mdash;aye, the lovely
      Georgine de Versannes herself&mdash;had picked up this bracelet in the
      street&mdash;by chance, as it were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It so happened,&rdquo; said the Colonel, &ldquo;that I was at her mother-in-law&rsquo;s,
      where she was going to dine. She came in looking as innocent as you
      please, with her hand in her pocket. &lsquo;Oh, see what I have found!&rsquo; she
      cried. &lsquo;I stepped upon it almost at your door.&rsquo; And the bracelet was
      placed under a lamp, where the diamonds shot out sparkles fit to blind the
      old Marquise, and make that old fool of a Versannes see a thousand lights.
      He has long known better than to take all his wife says for gospel&mdash;but
      he tries hard to pretend that he believes her. &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you
      must take that to the police.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll send it to-morrow morning,&rsquo; 
      says the charming Georgine, &lsquo;but I wished to show you my good luck.&rsquo; Of
      course nobody came forward to claim the bracelet, and a month later Madame
      de Versannes appeared at the Cranfords&rsquo; ball with a brilliant diamond
      bracelet, worn like the Queen of Sheba&rsquo;s, high up on her arm, near the
      shoulder, to hide the lack of sleeve. This piece of finery, which drew
      everybody&rsquo;s attention to the wearer, was the famous bracelet picked up in
      the street. Clever of her!&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horrid! Unlikely! Impossible.... What do you mean us to understand about
      it, Colonel? Could she have...?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the Colonel went on to demonstrate, with many coarse insinuations,
      that that good Georgine, as he familiarly called her, had done many more
      things than people gave her credit for. And he went on to add: &ldquo;Surely,
      you must have heard of the row about her between Givrac and the
      Homme-Volant at the Cirque?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, the man that wears stockinet all covered with gold scales? Do tell
      us, Colonel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But here Madame de Nailles gave a dry little cough which was meant to
      impose silence on the subject. She was not a prude, but she disapproved of
      anything that was bad form at her receptions. The Colonel&rsquo;s revelations
      had to be made in a lower tone, while his hostess endeavored to bring back
      the conversation to the charming reply made by M. Renan to the somewhat
      insipid address of a member of the Academie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t hear anything more now,&rdquo; said Colette, with a sigh. &ldquo;Did you
      understand it, Jacqueline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understand&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that story about the bracelet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not all. The Colonel seemed to imply that she had not picked it
      up, and indeed I don&rsquo;t see how any one could have dropped in the street,
      in broad daylight, a bracelet meant only to be worn at night&mdash;a
      bracelet worn near the shoulder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if she did not pick it up&mdash;she must have stolen it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stolen it?&rdquo; cried Belle. &ldquo;Stolen it! What! The Marquise de Versannes?
      Why, she inherited the finest diamonds in Paris!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because mamma sometimes takes me to the Opera, and her subscription day
      is the same as that of the Marquise. People say a good deal of harm of her&mdash;in
      whispers. They say she is barely received now in society, that people turn
      their backs on her, and so forth, and so on. However, that did not hinder
      her from being superb the other evening at &lsquo;Polyeucte&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you only go to see &lsquo;Polyeucte&rsquo;?&rdquo; said Jacqueline, making a little face
      as if she despised that opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have seen it twice. Mamma lets me go to &lsquo;Polyeucte&rsquo; and &lsquo;Guillaume
      Tell&rsquo;, and to the &lsquo;Prophete&rsquo;, but she won&rsquo;t take me to see &lsquo;Faust&rsquo;&mdash;and
      it is just &lsquo;Faust&rsquo; that I want to see. Isn&rsquo;t it provoking that one can&rsquo;t
      see everything, hear everything, understand everything? You see, we could
      not half understand that story which seemed to amuse the people so much in
      the other room. Why did they send back the bracelet from the Prefecture to
      Madame de Versannes if it was not hers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;why?&rdquo; said all the little girls, much puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, as the hour for closing the exhibition at the neighboring
      hippodrome had arrived, visitors came pouring into Madame de Nailles&rsquo;s
      reception&mdash;tall, graceful women, dressed with taste and elegance, as
      befitted ladies who were interested in horsemanship. The tone of the
      conversation changed. Nothing was talked about but superb horses, leaps
      over ribbons and other obstacles. The young girls interested themselves in
      the spring toilettes, which they either praised or criticised as they
      passed before their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! there is Madame Villegry,&rdquo; cried Jacqueline; &ldquo;how handsome she is! I
      should like one of these days to be that kind of beauty, so tall and
      slender. Her waist measure is only twenty-one and two thirds inches. The
      woman who makes her corsets and my mamma&rsquo;s told us so. She brought us one
      of her corsets to look at, a love of a corset, in brocatelle, all over
      many-colored flowers. That material is much more &lsquo;distingue&rsquo; than the old
      satin&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what a queer idea it is to waste all that upon a thing that nobody
      will ever look at,&rdquo; said Dolly, her round eyes opening wider than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is just to please herself, I suppose. I understand that! Besides,
      nothing is too good for such a figure. But what I admire most is her
      extraordinary hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which changes its color now and then,&rdquo; observed the sharpest of the three
      Wermant sisters. &ldquo;Extraordinary is just the word for it. At present it is
      dark red. Henna did that, I suppose. Raoul&mdash;our brother&mdash;when he
      was in Africa saw Arab women who used henna. They tied their heads up in a
      sort of poultice made of little leaves, something like tea-leaves. In
      twenty-four hours the hair will be dyed red, and will stay red for a year
      or more. You can try it if you like. I think it is disgusting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! look, there is Madame de Sternay. I recognized her by her perfume
      before I had even seen her. What delightful things good perfumes are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? Is it heliotrope or jessamine?&rdquo; asked Yvonne d&rsquo;Etaples,
      sniffing in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;it is only orris-root&mdash;nothing but orris-root; but she puts
      it everywhere about her&mdash;in the hem of her petticoat, in the lining
      of her dress. She lives, one might say, in the middle of a sachet. The
      thing that will please me most when I am married will be to have no limit
      to my perfumes. Till then I have to satisfy myself with very little,&rdquo;
       sighed Jacqueline, drawing a little bunch of violets from the loose folds
      of her blouse, and inhaling their fragrance with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tiens&rsquo;! here comes somebody who has to be contented with much less,&rdquo;
       said Yvonne, as a young girl joined their circle. She was small, awkward,
      timid, and badly dressed. On seeing her Colette whispered &ldquo;Oh! that
      tiresome Giselle. We sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be able to talk another word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline kissed Giselle de Monredon. They were distant cousins, though
      they saw each other very seldom. Giselle was an orphan, having lost both
      her father and her mother, and was being educated in a convent from which
      she was allowed to come out only on great occasions. Her grandmother,
      whose ideas were those of the old school, had placed her there. The Easter
      holidays accounted for Giselle&rsquo;s unexpected arrival. Wrapped in a large
      cloak which covered up her convent uniform, she looked, as compared with
      the gay girls around her, like a poor sombre night-moth, dazzled by the
      light, in company with other glittering creatures of the insect race,
      fluttering with graceful movements, transparent wings and shining
      corselets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and have some sandwiches,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, and she drew Giselle to
      the tea-table, with the kind intention apparently of making her feel more
      at her ease. But she had another motive. She saw some one who was very
      interesting to her coming at that moment toward the table. That some one
      was a man about forty, whose pointed black beard was becoming slightly
      gray&mdash;a man whom some people thought ugly, chiefly because they had
      never seen his somewhat irregular features illumined by a smile which,
      spreading from his lips to his eyes, lighted up his face and transformed
      it. The smile of Hubert Marien was rare, however. He was exclusive in his
      friendships, often silent, always somewhat unapproachable. He seldom
      troubled himself to please any one he did not care for. In society he was
      not seen to advantage, because he was extremely bored, for which reason he
      was seldom to be seen at the Tuesday receptions of Madame de Nailles;
      while, on other days, he frequented the house as an intimate friend of the
      family. Jacqueline had known him all her life, and for her he had always
      his beautiful smile. He had petted her when she was little, and had been
      much amused by the sort of adoration she had no hesitation in showing that
      she felt for him. He used to call her Mademoiselle ma femme, and M. de
      Nailles would speak of him as &ldquo;my daughter&rsquo;s future husband.&rdquo; This joke
      had been kept up till the little lady had reached her ninth year, when it
      ceased, probably by order of Madame de Nailles, who in matters of
      propriety was very punctilious. Jacqueline, too, became less familiar than
      she had been with the man she called &ldquo;my great painter.&rdquo; Indeed, in her
      heart of hearts, she cherished a grudge against him. She thought he
      presumed on the right he had assumed of teasing her. The older she grew
      the more he treated her as if she were a baby, and, in the little passages
      of arms that continually took place between them, Jacqueline was bitterly
      conscious that she no longer had the best of it as formerly. She was no
      longer as droll and lively as she had been. She was easily disconcerted,
      and took everything &lsquo;au serieux&rsquo;, and her wits became paralyzed by an
      embarrassment that was new to her. And, pained by the sort of sarcasm
      which Marien kept up in all their intercourse, she was often ready to
      burst into tears after talking to him. Yet she was never quite satisfied
      unless he was present. She counted the days from one Wednesday to another,
      for on Wednesdays he always dined with them, and she greeted any
      opportunity of seeing him on other days as a great pleasure. This week,
      for example, would be marked with a white stone. She would have seen him
      twice. For half an hour Marien had been enduring the bore of the
      reception, standing silent and self-absorbed in the midst of the gay talk,
      which did not interest him. He wished to escape, but was always kept from
      doing so by some word or sign from Madame de Nailles. Jacqueline had been
      thinking: &ldquo;Oh! if he would only come and talk to us!&rdquo; He was now drawing
      near them, and an instinct made her wish to rush up to him and tell him&mdash;what
      should she tell him? She did not know. A few moments before so many things
      to tell him had been passing through her brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      What she said was: &ldquo;Monsieur Marien, I recommend to you these little
      spiced cakes.&rdquo; And, with some awkwardness, because her hand was trembling,
      she held out the plate to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said, affecting a tone of great
      ceremony, &ldquo;I prefer to take this glass of punch, if you will permit me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The punch is cold, I fear; suppose we were to put a little tea in it.
      Stay&mdash;let me help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand thanks; but I like to attend to such little cookeries myself.
      By the way, it seems to me that Mademoiselle Giselle, in her character of
      an angel who disapproves of the good things of this life, has not left us
      much to eat at your table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&mdash;I?&rdquo; cried the poor schoolgirl, in a tone of injured innocence
      and astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pay any attention to him,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, as if taking her under
      her protection. &ldquo;He is nothing but a tease; what he says is only chaff.
      But I might as well talk Greek to her,&rdquo; she added, shrugging her
      shoulders. &ldquo;In the convent they don&rsquo;t know what to make of a joke. Only
      spare her at least, if you please, Monsieur Marien.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know by report that Mademoiselle Giselle is worthy of the most profound
      respect,&rdquo; continued the pitiless painter. &ldquo;I lay myself at her feet&mdash;and
      at yours. Now I am going to slip away in the English fashion.
      Good-evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you go so soon? You can&rsquo;t do any more work today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it has been a day lost&mdash;that is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s polite! By the way&rdquo;&mdash;here Jacqueline became very red and she
      spoke rapidly&mdash;&ldquo;what made you just now stare at me so persistently?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Impossible that I could have permitted myself to stare at you,
      Mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just what you did, though. I thought you had found something to
      find fault with. What could it be? I fancied there was something wrong
      with my hair, something absurd that you were laughing at. You always do
      laugh, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong with your hair? It is always wrong. But that is not your fault. You
      are not responsible for its looking like a hedgehog&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hedgehogs haven&rsquo;t any hair,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, much hurt by the
      observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, they have only prickles, which remind me of the susceptibility of
      your temper. I beg your pardon I was looking at you critically. Being
      myself indulgent and kindhearted, I was only looking at you from an
      artist&rsquo;s point of view&mdash;as is always allowable in my profession.
      Remember, I see you very rarely by daylight. I am obliged to work as long
      as the light allows me. Well, in the light of this April sunshine I was
      saying to myself&mdash;excuse my boldness!&mdash;that you had reached the
      right age for a picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a picture? Were you thinking of painting me?&rdquo; cried Jacqueline,
      radiant with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold a moment, please. Between a dream and its execution lies a great
      space. I was only imagining a picture of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my portrait would be frightful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly. But that would depend on the skill of the painter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet a model should be&mdash;I am so thin,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, with
      confusion and discouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; your limbs are like a grasshopper&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you mean my legs&mdash;but my arms....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your arms must be like your legs. But, sitting as you were just now, I
      could see only your head, which is better. So! one has to be accountable
      for looking at you? Mademoiselle feels herself affronted if any one stares
      at her! I will remember this in future. There, now! suppose, instead of
      quarrelling with me, you were to go and cast yourself into the arms of
      your cousin Fred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fred! Fred d&rsquo;Argy! Fred is at Brest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are your eyes, my dear child? He has just come in with his mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And at that moment Madame de Nailles, with her pure, clear voice&mdash;a
      voice frequently compared to that of Mademoiselle Reichemberg, called:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacqueline!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline never crossed the imaginary line which divided the two salons
      unless she was called upon to do so. She was still summoned like a child
      to speak to certain persons who took an especial interest in her, and who
      were kind enough to wish to see her&mdash;Madame d&rsquo;Argy, for example, who
      had been the dearest friend of her dead mother. The death of that mother,
      who had been long replaced by a stepmother, could hardly be said to be
      deeply regretted by Jacqueline. She remembered her very indistinctly. The
      stories of her she had heard from Modeste, her old nurse, probably served
      her instead of any actual memory. She knew her only as a woman pale and in
      ill health, always lying on a sofa. The little black frock that had been
      made for her had been hardly worn out when a new mamma, as gay and fresh
      as the other had been sick and suffering, had come into the household like
      a ray of sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that time Madame d&rsquo;Argy and Modeste were the only people who spoke
      to her of the mother who was gone. Madame d&rsquo;Argy, indeed, came on certain
      days to take her to visit the tomb, on which the child read, as she prayed
      for the departed:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         MARIE JACQUELINE ADELAIDE DE VALTIER

              BARONNE DE NAILLES

            DIED AGED TWENTY-SIX YEARS
</pre>
    <p>
      And such filial sentiment as she still retained, concerning the unknown
      being who had been her mother, was tinged by her association with this
      melancholy pilgrimage which she was expected to perform at certain
      intervals. Without exactly knowing the reason why, Jacqueline was
      conscious of a certain hostility that existed between Madame d&rsquo;Argy and
      her stepmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intimate friend of the first Madame de Nailles was a woman with
      neither elegance nor beauty. She never had left off her widow&rsquo;s weeds,
      which she had worn since she had lost her husband in early youth. In the
      eyes of Jacqueline her sombre figure personified austere, exacting Duty, a
      kind of duty not attractive to her. That very day it seemed as if duty
      inconveniently stepped in to break up a conversation that was deeply
      interesting to her. The impatient gesture that she made when her mother
      called her might have been interpreted into: Bother Madame d&rsquo;Argy!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacqueline!&rdquo; called again the silvery voice that had first summoned her;
      and a moment after the young girl found herself in the centre of a circle
      of grown people, saying good-morning, making curtseys, and kissing the
      withered hand of old Madame de Monredon, as she had been taught to do from
      infancy. Madame de Monredon was Giselle&rsquo;s grandmother. Jacqueline had been
      instructed to call her &ldquo;aunt;&rdquo; but in her heart she called her &lsquo;La Fee
      Gyognon&rsquo;, while Madame d&rsquo;Argy, pointing to her son, said: &ldquo;What do you
      think, darling, of such a surprise? He is home on leave. We came here the
      first place-naturally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very nice of you. How do you do, Fred?&rdquo; said Jacqueline, holding
      out her hand to a very young man, in a jacket ornamented with gold lace,
      who stood twisting his cap in his hand with some embarrassment &ldquo;It is a
      long time since we have seen each other. But it does not seem to me that
      you have grown a great deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fred blushed up to the roots of his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one can say that of you, Jacqueline,&rdquo; observed Madame d&rsquo;Argy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;what a may-pole!&mdash;isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; said the Baronne, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she realizes it,&rdquo; whispered Madame de Monredon, who was sitting beside
      Madame d&rsquo;Argy on a &lsquo;causeuse&rsquo; shaped like an S, &ldquo;why does she persist in
      dressing her like a child six years old? It is absurd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, she can have no reason for keeping her thus in order to make
      herself seem young. She is only a stepmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. But people might make comparisons. Beauty in the bud sometimes
      blooms out unexpectedly when it is not welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;she is fading fast. Small women ought not to grow stout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow, I have no patience with her for keeping a girl of fifteen in
      short skirts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are making her out older than she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that?&mdash;how is that? She is two years younger than Giselle,
      who has just entered her eighteenth year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the two ladies were exchanging these little remarks, the Baronne de
      Nailles was saying to the young naval cadet:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Fred, we should be charmed to keep you with us, but possibly you
      might like to see some of your old friends. Jacqueline can take you to
      them. They will be glad to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tiens!&mdash;that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Jacqueline. &ldquo;Dolly and Belle are yonder.
      You remember Isabelle Ray, who used to take dancing lessons with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; said Fred, following his cousin with a feeling of regret
      that his sword was not knocking against his legs, increasing his
      importance in the eyes of all the ladies who were present. He was not,
      however; sorry to leave their imposing circle. Above all, he was glad to
      escape from the clear-sighted, critical eyes of Madame de Nailles. On the
      other hand, to be sent off to the girls&rsquo; corner, after being insulted by
      being told he had not grown, hurt his sense of self-importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Jacqueline was taking him back to her own corner, where he was
      greeted by two or three little exclamations of surprise, shaking hands,
      however, as his former playmates drew their skirts around them, trying to
      make room for him to sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young ladies,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, &ldquo;I present to you a &lsquo;bordachien&rsquo;&mdash;a
      little middy from the practice-ship the Borda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They burst out laughing: &ldquo;A bordachien! A middy from the practice-ship!&rdquo;
       they cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not be much longer on the practice-ship,&rdquo; said the young man,
      with a gesture which seemed as if his hand were feeling for the hilt of
      his sword, which was not there, &ldquo;for I am going very soon on my first
      voyage as an ensign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; explained Jacqueline, &ldquo;he is going to be transferred from the
      &lsquo;Borda&rsquo; to the &lsquo;Jean-Bart&rsquo;&mdash;which, by the way, is no longer the
      &lsquo;Jean-Bart&rsquo;, only people call her so because they are used to it. Meantime
      you see before you &ldquo;C,&rdquo; the great &ldquo;C,&rdquo; the famous &ldquo;C,&rdquo; that is, he is the
      pupil who stands highest on the roll of the naval school at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a vague murmur of applause. Poor Fred was indeed in need of some
      appreciation on the score of merit, for he was not much to look upon,
      being at that trying age when a young fellow&rsquo;s moustache is only a light
      down, an age at which youths always look their worst, and are awkward and
      unsociable because they are timid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are no longer an idle fellow,&rdquo; said Dolly, rather teasingly.
      &ldquo;People used to say that you went into the navy to get rid of your
      lessons. That I can quite understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he has passed many difficult exams,&rdquo; cried Giselle, coming to the
      rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I had had enough of school,&rdquo; said Fred, without making any
      defense, &ldquo;and besides I had other reasons for going into the navy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His &ldquo;other reasons&rdquo; had been a wish to emancipate himself from the
      excessive solicitude of his mother, who kept him tied to her apron-strings
      like a little girl. He was impatient to do something for himself, to
      become a man as soon as possible. But he said nothing of all this, and to
      escape further questions devoured three or four little cakes that were
      offered him. Before taking them he removed his gloves and displayed a pair
      of chapped and horny hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;poor Fred!&rdquo; cried Jacqueline, who remarked them in a moment,
      &ldquo;what kind of almond paste do you use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Much annoyed, he replied, curtly: &ldquo;We all have to row, we have also to
      attend to the machinery. But that is only while we are cadets. Of course,
      such apprenticeship is very hard. After that we shall get our stripes and
      be ordered on foreign service, and expect promotion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And glory,&rdquo; said Giselle, who found courage to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred thanked her with a look of gratitude. She, at least, understood his
      profession. She entered into his feelings far better than Jacqueline, who
      had been his first confidante&mdash;Jacqueline, to whom he had confided
      his purposes, his ambition, and his day-dreams. He thought Jacqueline was
      selfish. She seemed to care only for herself. And yet, selfish or not
      selfish, she pleased him better than all the other girls he knew&mdash;a
      thousand times more than gentle, sweet Giselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, glory, of course!&rdquo; repeated Jacqueline. &ldquo;I understand how much that
      counts, but there is glory of various kinds, and I know the kind that I
      prefer,&rdquo; she added in a tone which seemed to imply that it was not that of
      arms, or of perilous navigation. &ldquo;We all know,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;that not
      every man can have genius, but any sailor who has good luck can get to be
      an admiral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hope you will be one soon, Monsieur Fred,&rdquo; said Dolly. &ldquo;You will
      have well deserved it, according to the way you have distinguished
      yourself on board the &lsquo;Borda.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This induced Fred to let them understand something of life on board the
      practice-ship; he told how the masters who resided on shore ascended by a
      ladder to the gun-deck, which had been turned into a schoolroom; how six
      cadets occupied the space intended for each gun-carriage, where hammocks
      hung from hooks served them instead of beds; how the chapel was in a
      closet opened only on Sundays. He described the gymnastic feats in the
      rigging, the practice in gunnery, and many other things which, had they
      been well described, would have been interesting; but Fred was only a poor
      narrator. The conclusion the young ladies seemed to reach unanimously
      after hearing his descriptions, was discouraging. They cried almost with
      one voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of any woman being willing to marry a sailor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Giselle, very promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, what&rsquo;s the use of a husband who is always out of your reach, as
      it were, between water and sky? One would better be a widow. Widows, at
      any rate, can marry again. But you, Giselle, don&rsquo;t understand these
      things. You are going to be a nun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had I been in your place, Fred,&rdquo; said Isabelle Ray, &ldquo;I should rather have
      gone into the cavalry school at Saint Cyr. I should have wanted to be a
      good huntsman, had I been a man, and they say naval officers are never
      good horsemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Fred! He was not making much progress among the young girls. Almost
      everything people talked about outside his cadet life was unknown to him;
      what he could talk about seemed to have no interest for any one, unless
      indeed it might interest Giselle, who was an adept in the art of
      sympathetic listening, never having herself anything to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides this, Fred was by no means at his ease in talking to Jacqueline.
      They had been told not to &lsquo;tutoyer&rsquo; each other, because they were getting
      too old for such familiarity, and it was he, and not she, who remembered
      this prohibition. Jacqueline perceived this after a while, and burst out
      laughing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tiens! You call me &lsquo;you,&rdquo;&rsquo; she cried, &ldquo;and I ought not to say &lsquo;thou&rsquo; but
      &lsquo;you.&rsquo; I forgot. It seems so odd, when we have always been accustomed to
      &lsquo;tutoyer&rsquo; each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One ought to give it up after one&rsquo;s first communion,&rdquo; said the eldest
      Mademoiselle Wermant, sententiously. &ldquo;We ceased to &lsquo;tutoyer&rsquo; our boy
      cousins after that. I am told nothing annoys a husband so much as to see
      these little familiarities between his wife and her cousins or her
      playmates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giselle looked very much astonished at this speech, and her air of
      disapproval amused Belle and Yvonne exceedingly. They began presently to
      talk of the classes in which they were considered brilliant pupils, and of
      their success in compositions. They said that sometimes very difficult
      subjects were given out. A week or two before, each had had to compose a
      letter purporting to be from Dante in exile to a friend in Florence,
      describing Paris as it was in his time, especially the manners and customs
      of its universities, ending by some allusion to the state of matters
      between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! And could you do it?&rdquo; said Giselle, whose knowledge of
      history was limited to what may be found in school abridgments.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was therefore a great satisfaction to her when Fred declared that he
      never should have known how to set about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! papa helped me a little,&rdquo; said Isabelle, whose father wrote articles
      much appreciated by the public in the &lsquo;Revue des Deux Mondes.&rsquo; &ldquo;But he
      said at the same time that it was horrid to give such crack-brained stuff
      to us poor girls. Happily, our subject this week is much nicer. We have to
      make comparisons between La Tristesse d&rsquo;Olympio, Souvenir, and Le Lac&rsquo;.
      That will be something interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Tristesse d&rsquo;Olympio?&rdquo; repeated Giselle, in a tone of interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, of course, that it is Victor Hugo&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle de
      Wermant, with a touch of pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giselle answered with sincerity and humility, &ldquo;I only knew that Le Lac was
      by Lamartine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&mdash;she knows that much,&rdquo; whispered Belle to Yvonne&mdash;&ldquo;just
      that much, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While they were whispering and laughing, Jacqueline recited, in a soft
      voice, and with feeling that did credit to her instructor in elocution,
      Mademoiselle X&mdash;&mdash;, of the Theatre Francais:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     May the moan of the wind, the green rushes&rsquo; soft sighing,
     The fragrance that floats in the air you have moved,
     May all heard, may all breathed, may all seen, seem but trying
     To say: They have loved.
</pre>
    <p>
      Then she added, after a pause: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that beautiful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dares she say such words?&rdquo; thought Giselle, whose sense of propriety
      was outraged by this allusion to love. Fred, too, looked askance and was
      not comfortable, for he thought that Jacqueline had too much assurance for
      her age, but that, after all, she was becoming more and more charming.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Belle and Yvonne were summoned, and they departed, full of
      an intention to spread everywhere the news that Giselle, the little goose,
      had actually known that Le Lac had been written by Lamartine. The
      Benedictine Sisters positively had acquired that much knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      These girls were not the only persons that day at the reception who
      indulged in a little ill-natured talk after going away. Mesdames d&rsquo;Argy
      and de Monredon, on their way to the Faubourg St. Germain, criticised
      Madame de Nailles pretty freely. As they crossed the Parc Monceau to reach
      their carriage, which was waiting for them on the Boulevard Malesherbes,
      they made the young people, Giselle and Fred, walk ahead, that they might
      have an opportunity of expressing themselves freely, the old dowager
      especially, whose toothless mouth never lost an opportunity of smirching
      the character and the reputation of her neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I think of the pains my poor cousin de Nailles took to impress upon
      us all that he was making what is called a &lsquo;mariage raisonnable&rsquo;! Well, if
      a man wants a wife who is going to set up her own notions, her own
      customs, he had better marry a poor girl without fortune! This one will
      simply ruin him. My dear, I am continually amazed at the way people are
      living whose incomes I know to the last sou. What an example for
      Jacqueline! Extravagance, fast living, elegant self-indulgence.... Did you
      observe the Baronne&rsquo;s gown?&mdash;of rough woolen stuff. She told some one
      it was the last creation of Doucet, and you know what that implies! His
      serge costs more than one of our velvet gowns.... And then her artistic
      tastes, her bric-a brac! Her salon looks like a museum or a bazaar. I
      grant you it makes a very pretty setting for her and all her coquetries.
      But in my time respectable women were contented with furniture covered
      with red or yellow silk damask furnished by their upholsterers. They
      didn&rsquo;t go about trying to hunt up the impossible. &lsquo;On ne cherche pas midi
      a quatorze heures&rsquo;. You hold, as I do, to the old fashions, though you are
      not nearly so old, my dear Elise, and Jacqueline&rsquo;s mother thought as we
      think. She would say that her daughter is being very badly brought up. To
      be sure, all young creatures nowadays are the same. Parents, on a plea of
      tenderness, keep them at home, where they get spoiled among grown people,
      when they had much better have the same kind of education that has
      succeeded so well with Giselle; bolts on the garden-gates, wholesome
      seclusion, the company of girls of their own age, a great regularity of
      life, nothing which stimulates either vanity or imagination. That is the
      proper way to bring up girls without notions, girls who will let
      themselves be married without opposition, and are satisfied with the state
      of life to which Providence may be pleased to call them. For my part, I am
      enchanted with the ladies in the Rue de Monsieur, and, what is more,
      Giselle is very happy among them; to hear her talk you would suppose she
      was quite ready to take the veil. Of course, that is a mere passing fancy.
      But fancies of that sort are never dangerous, they have nothing in common
      with those that are passing nowadays through most girls&rsquo; brains. Having &lsquo;a
      day!&rsquo;&mdash;what a foolish notion: And then to let little girls take part
      in it, even in a corner of the room. I&rsquo;ll wager that, though her skirts
      are half way up her legs, and her hair is dressed like a baby&rsquo;s, that that
      little de Nailles is less of a child than my granddaughter, who has been
      brought up by the Benedictines. You say that she probably does not
      understand all that goes on around her. Perhaps not, but she breathes it
      in. It&rsquo;s poison-that&rsquo;s what it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a good deal of truth in this harsh picture, although it
      contained considerable exaggeration.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, when Madame de Monredon was sitting in judgment on the
      education given to the little girls brought up in the world, and on the
      ruinous extravagance of their young stepmothers, Madame de Nailles and
      Jacqueline&mdash;their last visitors having departed&mdash;were resting
      themselves, leaning tenderly against each other, on a sofa. Jacqueline&rsquo;s
      head lay on her mother&rsquo;s lap. Her mother, without speaking, was stroking
      the girl&rsquo;s dark hair. Jacqueline, too, was silent, but from time to time
      she kissed the slender fingers sparkling with rings, as they came within
      reach of her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      When M. de Nailles, about dinner-time, surprised them thus, he said, with
      satisfaction, as he had often said before, that it would be hard to find a
      home scene more charming, as they sat under the light of a lamp with a
      pink shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the stepmother and stepdaughter adored each other was beyond a doubt.
      And yet, had any one been able to look into their hearts at that moment,
      he would have discovered with surprise that each was thinking of something
      that she could not confide to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both were thinking of the same person. Madame de Nailles was occupied with
      recollections, Jacqueline with hope. She was absorbed in Machiavellian
      strategy, how to realize a hope that had been formed that very afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you both thinking of, sitting there so quietly?&rdquo; said the Baron,
      stooping over them and kissing first his wife and then his child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About nothing,&rdquo; said the wife, with the most innocent of smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I am thinking,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, &ldquo;of many things. I have a secret,
      papa, that I want to tell you when we are quite alone. Don&rsquo;t be jealous,
      dear mamma. It is something about a surprise&mdash;Oh, a lovely surprise
      for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saint Clotilde&rsquo;s day-my fete-day is still far off,&rdquo; said Madame de
      Nailles, refastening, mother-like, the ribbon that was intended to keep in
      order the rough ripples of Jacqueline&rsquo;s unruly hair, &ldquo;and usually your
      whisperings begin as the day approaches my fete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear!&mdash;you will go and guess it!&rdquo; cried Jacqueline in alarm.
      &ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t guess it, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I will do my best not to guess, then,&rdquo; said the good-natured
      Clotilde, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I assure you, for my part, that I am discretion itself,&rdquo; said M. de
      Nailles.
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he drew his wife&rsquo;s arm within his own, and the three passed
      gayly together into the dining-room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. A CLEVER STEPMOTHER
    </h2>
    <p>
      No man took more pleasure than M. de Nailles in finding himself in his own
      home&mdash;partly, perhaps, because circumstances compelled him to be very
      little there. The post of deputy in the French Chamber is no sinecure. He
      was not often an orator from the tribune, but he was absorbed by work in
      the committees&mdash;&ldquo;Harnessed to a lot of bothering reports,&rdquo; as
      Jacqueline used to say to him. He had barely any time to give to those
      important duties of his position, by which, as is well known, members of
      the Corps Legislatif are shamelessly harassed by constituents, who, on
      pretence that they have helped to place the interests of their district in
      your hands, feel authorized to worry you with personal matters, such as
      the choice of agricultural machines, or a place to be found for a
      wet-nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides his public duties, M. de Nailles was occupied by financial
      speculations&mdash;operations that were no doubt made necessary by the
      style of living commented on by his cousin, Madame de Monredon, who was as
      stingy as she was bitter of tongue. The elegance that she found fault with
      was, however, very far from being great when compared with the luxury of
      the present day. Of course, the Baronne had to have her horses, her
      opera-box, her fashionable frocks. To supply these very moderate needs,
      which, however, she never insisted upon, being, so far as words went, most
      simple in her tastes, M. de Nailles, who had not the temperament which
      makes men find pleasure in hard work, became more and more fatigued. His
      days were passed in the Chamber, but he never neglected his interest on
      the Bourse; in the evening he accompanied his young wife into society,
      which, she always declared, she did not care for, but which had claims
      upon her nevertheless. It was therefore not surprising that M. de
      Nailles&rsquo;s face showed traces of the habitual fatigue that was fast aging
      him; his tall, thin form had acquired a slight stoop; though only fifty he
      was evidently in his declining years. He had once been a man of pleasure,
      it was said, before he entered politics. He had married his first wife
      late in life. She was a prudent woman who feared to expose him to
      temptation, and had kept him as far as possible away from Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the country, having nothing to do, he became interested in agriculture,
      and in looking after his estate at Grandchaux. He had been made a member
      of the Conseil General, when unfortunately death too early deprived him of
      the wise and gentle counsellor for whom he felt, possibly not a very
      lively love, but certainly a high esteem and affection. After he be came a
      widower he met in the Pyrenees, where, as he was whiling away the time of
      seclusion proper after his loss, a young lady who appeared to him exactly
      the person he needed to bring up his little daughter&mdash;because she was
      extremely attractive to himself. Of course M. de Nailles found plenty of
      other reasons for his choice, which he gave to the world and to himself to
      justify his second marriage&mdash;but this was the true reason and the
      only one. His friends, however, all of whom had urged on him the
      desirability of taking another wife, in consideration of the age of
      Jacqueline, raised many objections as soon as he announced his intention
      of espousing Mademoiselle Clotilde Hecker, eldest daughter of a man who
      had been, at one time, a prefect under the Empire, but who had been turned
      out of office by the Republican Government. He had a large family and many
      debts; but M. de Nailles had some answer always ready for the objections
      of his family and friends. He was convinced that Mademoiselle Hecker,
      having no fortune, would be less exacting than other women and more
      disposed to lead a quiet life.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been almost a mother to her own young brothers and sisters, which
      was a pledge for motherliness toward Jacqueline, etc., etc. Nevertheless,
      had she not had eyes as blue as those of the beauties painted by Greuze,
      plenty of audacious wit, and a delicate complexion, due to her Alsatian
      origin&mdash;had she not possessed a slender waist and a lovely figure, he
      might have asked himself why a young lady who, in winter, studied painting
      with the commendable intention of making her own living by art, passed the
      summers at all the watering-places of France and those of neighboring
      countries, without any perceptible motive.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, thanks to the bandage love ties over the eyes of men, he saw only
      what Mademoiselle Clotilde was willing that he should see. In the first
      place he saw the great desirability of a talent for painting which, unlike
      music&mdash;so often dangerous to married happiness&mdash;gives women who
      cultivate it sedentary interests. And then he was attracted by the model
      daughter&rsquo;s filial piety as he beheld her taking care of her mother, who
      was the victim of an incurable disorder, which required her by turns to
      reside at Cauterets, or sometimes at Ems, sometimes at Aix in Savoy, and
      sometimes even at Trouville. The poor girl had assured him that she asked
      no happier lot than to live eight months of the year in the country, where
      she would devote herself to teaching Jacqueline, for whom at first sight
      she had taken a violent fancy (the attraction indeed was mutual). She
      assured him she would teach her all she knew herself, and her diplomas
      proved how well educated she had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, it seemed as if only prejudice could find any objection to so
      prudent and reasonable a marriage, a marriage contracted principally for
      the good of Jacqueline.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came to pass, however, that the air of Grandchaux, which is situated in
      the most unhealthful part of Limouzin, proved particularly hurtful to the
      new Madame de Nailles. She could not live a month on her husband&rsquo;s
      property without falling into a state of health which she attributed to
      malaria. M. de Nailles was at first much concerned about the condition of
      things which seemed likely to upset all his plans for retirement in the
      country, but, his wife having persuaded him that his position in the
      Conseil General was only a stepping-stone to a seat in the Corps
      Legislatif, where his place ought to be, he presented himself to the
      electors as a candidate, and was almost unanimously elected deputy, the
      conservative vote being still all powerful in that part of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife, it was said, had shown rare zeal and activity at the time of the
      election, employing in her husband&rsquo;s service all those little arts which
      enable her sex to succeed in politics, as well as in everything else they
      set their minds to. No lady ever more completely turned the heads of
      country electors. It was really Madame de Nailles who took her seat in the
      Left Centre of the Chamber, in the person of her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that she returned to Limouzin only long enough to keep up her
      popularity, though, with touching resignation, she frequently offered to
      spend the summer at Grandchaux, even if the consequences should be her
      death, like that of Pia in the Maremma. Her husband, of course,
      peremptorily set his face against such self-sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The facilities for Jacqueline&rsquo;s education were increased by their settling
      down as residents of Paris. Madame de Nailles superintended the
      instruction of her stepdaughter with motherly solicitude, seconded,
      however, by a &lsquo;promeneuse&rsquo;, or walking-governess, which left her free to
      fulfil her own engagements in the afternoons. The walking-governess is a
      singular modern institution, intended to supply the place of the too often
      inconvenient daily governess of former times. The necessary qualifications
      of such a person are that she should have sturdy legs, and such knowledge
      of some foreign language as will enable her during their walks to converse
      in it with her pupil. Fraulein Schult, who came from one of the German
      cantons of Switzerland, was an ideal &lsquo;promeneuse&rsquo;. She never was tired and
      she was well-informed. The number of things that could be learned from her
      during a walk was absolutely incredible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Nailles, therefore, after a time, gave up to her, not without
      apparent regret, the duty of accompanying Jacqueline, while she herself
      fulfilled those duties to society which the most devoted of mothers can
      not wholly avoid; but the stepmother and stepdaughter were always to be
      seen together at mass at one o&rsquo;clock; together they attended the Cours
      (that system of classes now so much in vogue) and also the weekly
      instruction given in the catechism; and if Madame de Nailles, when, at
      night, she told her husband all she had been doing for Jacqueline during
      the day (she never made any merit of her zeal for the child&rsquo;s welfare),
      added: &ldquo;I left Jacqueline in this place or in that, where Mademoiselle
      Schult was to call for her,&rdquo; M. de Nailles showed no disposition to ask
      questions, for he well understood that his wife felt a certain delicacy in
      telling him that she had been to pay a brief visit to her own relatives,
      who, she knew, were distasteful to him. He had, indeed, very soon
      discerned in them a love of intrigue, a desire to get the most they could
      out of him, and a disagreeable propensity to parasitism. With the
      consummate tact she showed in everything she did, Madame de Nailles kept
      her own family in the background, though she never neglected them. She was
      always doing them little services, but she knew well that there were
      certain things about them that could not but be disagreeable to her
      husband. M. de Nailles knew all this, too, and respected his wife&rsquo;s
      affection for her family. He seldom asked her where she had been during
      the day. If he had she would have answered, with a sigh: &ldquo;I went to see my
      mother while Jacqueline was taking her dancing-lesson, and before she went
      to her singing-master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That she was passionately attached to Jacqueline was proved by the
      affection the little girl conceived for her. &ldquo;We two are friends,&rdquo; both
      mother and daughter often said of each other. Even Modeste, old Modeste,
      who had been at first indignant at seeing a stranger take the place of her
      dead mistress, could not but acknowledge that the usurper was no ordinary
      step mother. It might have been truly said that Madame de Nailles had
      never scolded Jacqueline, and that Jacqueline had never done anything
      contrary to the wishes of Madame de Nailles. When anything went wrong it
      was Fraulein Schult who was reproached first; if there was any difficulty
      in the management of Jacqueline, she alone received complaints. In the
      eyes of the &ldquo;two friends,&rdquo; Fraulein Schult was somehow to be blamed for
      everything that went wrong in the family, but between themselves an
      observer might have watched in vain for the smallest cloud. Madame de
      Nailles, when she was first married, could not make enough of the very
      ugly yet attractive little girl, whose tight black curls and gypsy face
      made an admirable contrast to her own more delicate style of beauty, which
      was that of a blonde. She caressed Jacqueline, she dressed her up, she
      took her about with her like a little dog, and overwhelmed her with
      demonstrations of affection, which served not only to show off her own
      graceful attitudes, but gave spectators a high opinion of her kindness of
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      When from time to time some one, envious of her happiness, pitied her for
      being childless, Madame de Nailles would say: &ldquo;What do you mean? I have
      one daughter; she is enough for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is a pity children grow so fast, and that little girls who were once
      ugly sometimes develop into beautiful young women. The time came when the
      model stepmother began to wish that Jacqueline would only develop morally,
      intellectually, and not physically. But she showed nothing of this in her
      behavior, and replied to any compliments addressed to her concerning
      Jacqueline with as much maternal modesty as if the dawning loveliness of
      her stepdaughter had been due to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her nose is rather too long-don&rsquo;t you think so? And she will always be
      too dark, I fear.&rdquo; But she used always to add, &ldquo;She is good enough and
      pretty enough to pass muster with any critic&mdash;poor little pussy-cat!&rdquo;
       She became desirous to discover some tendency to ill-health in the plant
      that was too ready to bloom into beauty and perfection. She would have
      liked to be able to assert that Jacqueline&rsquo;s health would not permit her
      to sit up late at night, that fashionable hours would be injurious to her,
      that it would be undesirable to let her go into society as long as she
      could be kept from doing so. But Jacqueline persisted in never being ill,
      and was calculating with impatience how many years it would be before she
      could go to her first ball&mdash;three or four possibly. Was Madame de
      Nailles in three or four years to be reduced to the position of a
      chaperon? The young stepmother thought of such a possibility with horror.
      Her anxiety on this subject, however, as well as several other anxieties,
      was so well concealed that even her husband suspected nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The complete sympathy which existed between the two beings he most loved
      made M. de Nailles very happy. He had but one thing to complain of in his
      wife, and that thing was very small. Since she had married she had
      completely given up her painting. He had no knowledge of art himself, and
      had therefore given her credit for great artistic capacity. The fact was
      that in her days of poverty she had never been artist enough to make a
      living, and now that she was rich she felt inclined to laugh at her own
      limited ability. Her practice of art, she said, had only served to give
      her a knowledge of outline and of color; a knowledge she utilized in her
      dress and in the smallest details of house decoration and furniture.
      Everything she wore, everything that surrounded her, was arranged to
      perfection. She had a genius for decoration, for furniture, for trifles,
      and brought her artistic knowledge to bear even on the tying of a ribbon,
      or the arrangement of a nosegay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is all I retain of your lessons,&rdquo; she said sometimes to Hubert
      Marien, when recalling to his memory the days in which she sought his
      advice as to how to prepare herself for the &ldquo;struggle for life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This phrase was amusing when it proceeded from her lips. What!&mdash;&ldquo;struggle
      for life&rdquo; with those little delicate, soft, childlike hands? How absurd!
      She laughed at the idea now, and all those who heard her laughed with her;
      Marien laughed more than any one. He, who had befriended her in her days
      of adversity, seemed to retain for the Baroness in her prosperity the same
      respectful and discreet devotion he had shown her as Mademoiselle Hecker.
      He had sent a wonderful portrait of her, as the wife of M. de Nailles, to
      the Salon&mdash;a portrait that the richer electors of Grandchaux, who had
      voted for her husband and who could afford to travel, gazed at with
      satisfaction, congratulating themselves that they had a deputy who had
      married so pretty a woman. It even seemed as if the beauty of Madame de
      Nailles belonged in some sort to the arrondissement, so proud were those
      who lived there of having their share in her charms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another portrait&mdash;that of M. de Nailles himself&mdash;was sent down
      to Limouzin from Paris, and all the peasants in the country round were
      invited to come and look at it. That also produced a very favorable
      impression on the rustic public, and added to the popularity of their
      deputy. Never had the proprietor of Grandchaux looked so grave, so
      dignified, so majestic, so absorbed in deep reflection, as he looked
      standing beside a table covered with papers&mdash;papers, no doubt, all
      having relation to local interests, important to the public and to
      individuals. It was the very figure of a statesman destined to high
      dignities. No one who gazed on such a deputy could doubt that one day he
      would be in the ministry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was by such real services that Marien endeavored to repay the
      friendship and the kindness always awaiting him in the small house in the
      Parc Monceau, where we have just seen Jacqueline eagerly offering him some
      spiced cakes. To complete what seemed due to the household there only
      remained to paint the curiously expressive features of the girl at whom he
      had been looking that very day with more than ordinary attention. Once
      already, when Jacqueline was hardly out of baby-clothes, the great painter
      had made an admirable sketch of her tousled head, a sketch in which she
      looked like a little imp of darkness, and this sketch Madame de Nailles
      took pains should always be seen, but it bore no resemblance to the
      slender young girl who was on the eve of becoming, whatever might be done
      to arrest her development, a beautiful young woman. Jacqueline disliked to
      look at that picture. It seemed to do her an injury by associating her
      with her nursery. Probably that was the reason why she had been so pleased
      to hear Hubert Marien say unexpectedly that she was now ready for the
      portrait which had been often joked about, every one putting it off to the
      period, always remote, when &ldquo;the may-pole&rdquo; should have developed a pretty
      face and figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now she was disquieted lest the idea of taking her picture, which she
      felt was very flattering, should remain inoperative in the painter&rsquo;s
      brain. She wanted it carried out at once, as soon as possible. Jacqueline
      detested waiting, and for some reason, which she never talked about, the
      years that seemed so short and swift to her stepmother seemed to her to be
      terribly long. Marien himself had said: &ldquo;There is a great interval between
      a dream and its execution.&rdquo; These words had thrown cold water on her
      sudden joy. She wanted to force him to keep his promise&mdash;to paint her
      portrait immediately. How to do this was the problem her little head,
      reclining on Madame de Nailles&rsquo;s lap after the departure of their
      visitors, had been endeavoring to solve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should she communicate her wish to her indulgent stepmother, who for the
      most part willed whatever she wished her to do? A vague instinct&mdash;an
      instinct of some mysterious danger&mdash;warned her that in this case her
      father would be her better confidant.

      CHAPTER III. THE FRIEND OF THE FAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      A week later M. de Nailles said to Hubert Marien, as they were smoking
      together in the conservatory, after the usual little family dinner on
      Wednesday was over:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&mdash;when would you like Jacqueline to come to sit for her
      picture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! are you thinking about that?&rdquo; cried the painter, letting his cigar
      fall in his astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told me that you had proposed to make her portrait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sly little minx!&rdquo; thought Marien. &ldquo;I only spoke of painting it some
      day,&rdquo; he said, with embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! she would like that &lsquo;some day&rsquo; to be now, and she has a reason for
      wanting it at once, which, I hope, will decide you to gratify her. The
      third of June is Sainte-Clotilde&rsquo;s day, and she has taken it into her head
      that she would like to give her mamma a magnificent present&mdash;a
      present that, of course, we shall unite to give her. For some time past I
      have been thinking of asking you to paint a portrait of my daughter,&rdquo;
       continued M. de Nailles, who had in fact had no more wish for the portrait
      than he had had to be a deputy, until it had been put into his head. But
      the women of his household, little or big, could persuade him into
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t think I have the time now,&rdquo; said Marien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&mdash;you have whole two months before you. What can absorb you so
      entirely? I know you have your pictures ready for the Salon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;of course&mdash;of course&mdash;but are you sure that Madame de
      Nailles would approve of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will approve whatever I sanction,&rdquo; said M. de Nailles, with as much
      assurance as if he had been master in his domestic circle; &ldquo;besides, we
      don&rsquo;t intend to ask her. It is to be a surprise. Jacqueline is looking
      forward to the pleasure it will give her. There is something very touching
      to me in the affection of that little thing for&mdash;for her mother.&rdquo; M.
      de Nailles usually hesitated a moment before saying that word, as if he
      were afraid of transferring something still belonging to his dead wife to
      another&mdash;that dead wife he so seldom remembered in any other way. He
      added, &ldquo;She is so eager to give her pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marien shook his head with an air of uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure that such a portrait would be really acceptable to Madame de
      Nailles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you doubt it?&rdquo; said the Baron, with much astonishment. &ldquo;A
      portrait of her daughter!&mdash;done by a great master? However, of
      course, if we are putting you to any inconvenience&mdash;if you would
      rather not undertake it, you had better say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;of course I will do it, if you wish it,&rdquo; said Marien, quickly,
      who, although he was anxious to do nothing to displease Madame de Nailles,
      was equally desirous to stand well with her husband. &ldquo;Yet I own that all
      the mystery that must attend on what you propose may put me to some
      embarrassment. How do you expect Jacqueline will be able to conceal&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! easily enough. She walks out every day with Mademoiselle Schult.
      Well, Mademoiselle Schult will bring her to your studio instead of taking
      her to the Champs Elysees&mdash;or to walk elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But every day there will be concealments, falsehoods, deceptions. I think
      Madame de Nailles might prefer to be asked for her permission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask for her permission when I have given mine? Ah, fa! my dear Marien, am
      I, or am I not, the father, of Jacqueline? I take upon myself the whole
      responsibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is nothing more to be said. But do you think that Jacqueline
      will keep the secret till the picture is done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know little girls; they are all too glad to have something of
      which they can make a mystery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When would you like us to begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marien had by this time said to himself that for him to hold out longer
      might seem strange to M. de Nailles. Besides, the matter, though in some
      respects it gave him cause for anxiety, really excited an interest in him.
      For some time past, though he had long known women and knew very little of
      mere girls, he had had his suspicions that a drama was being enacted in
      Jacqueline&rsquo;s heart, a drama of which he himself was the hero. He amused
      himself by watching it, though he did nothing to promote it. He was an
      artist and a keen and penetrating observer; he employed psychology in the
      service of his art, and probably to that might have been attributed the
      individual character of his portraits&mdash;a quality to be found in an
      equal degree only in those of Ricard.
    </p>
    <p>
      What particularly interested him at this moment was the assumed
      indifference of Jacqueline while her father was conducting the negotiation
      which was of her suggestion. When they returned to the salon after smoking
      she pretended not to be the least anxious to know the result of their
      conversation. She sat sewing near the lamp, giving all her attention to
      the piece of lace on which she was working. Her father made her a sign
      which meant &ldquo;He consents,&rdquo; and then Marien saw that the needle in her
      fingers trembled, and a slight color rose in her face&mdash;but that was
      all. She did not say a word. He could not know that for a week past she
      had gone to church every time she took a walk, and had offered a prayer
      and a candle that her wish might be granted. How very anxious and excited
      she had been all that week! The famous composition of which she had spoken
      to Giselle, the subject of which had so astonished the young girl brought
      up by the Benedictine nuns, felt the inspiration of her emotion and
      excitement. Jacqueline was in a frame of mind which made reading those
      three masterpieces by three great poets, and pondering the meaning of
      their words, very dangerous. The poems did not affect her with the
      melancholy they inspire in those who have &ldquo;lived and loved,&rdquo; but she was
      attracted by their tenderness and their passion. Certain lines she applied
      to herself&mdash;certain others to another person. The very word love so
      often repeated in the verses sent a thrill through all her frame. She
      aspired to taste those &ldquo;intoxicating moments,&rdquo; those &ldquo;swift delights,&rdquo;
       those &ldquo;sublime ecstasies,&rdquo; those &ldquo;divine transports&rdquo;&mdash;all the
      beautiful things, in short, of which the poems spoke, and which were as
      yet unknown to her. How could she know them? How could she, after an
      experience of sorrow, which seemed to her to be itself enviable, retain
      such sweet remembrances as the poets described?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us love&mdash;love each other! Let us hasten to enjoy the passing
      hour!&rdquo; so sang the poet of Le Lac. That passing hour of bliss she thought
      she had already enjoyed. She was sure that for a long time past she had
      loved. When had that love begun? She hardly knew. But it would last as
      long as she might live. One loves but once.
    </p>
    <p>
      These personal emotions, mingling with the literary enchantments of the
      poets, caused Jacqueline&rsquo;s pen to fly over her paper without effort, and
      she produced a composition so far superior to anything she usually wrote
      that it left the lucubrations of her companions far behind. M. Regis, the
      professor, said so to the class. He was enthusiastic about it, and greatly
      surprised. Belle, who had been always first in this kind of composition,
      was far behind Jacqueline, and was so greatly annoyed at her defeat that
      she would not speak to her for a week. On the other hand Colette and
      Dolly, who never had aspired to literary triumphs, were moved to tears
      when the &ldquo;Study on the comparative merits of Three Poems, &lsquo;Le Lac,&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Souvenir,&rsquo; and &lsquo;La Tristesse d&rsquo;Olympio,&rsquo;&rdquo; signed &ldquo;Mademoiselle de
      Nailles,&rdquo; received the honor of being read aloud. This reading was
      followed by a murmur of applause, mingled with some hisses which may have
      proceeded from the viper of jealousy. But the paper made a sensation like
      that of some new scandal. Mothers and governesses whispered together. Many
      thought that that little de Nailles had expressed sentiments not proper at
      her age. Some came to the conclusion that M. Regis chose subjects for
      composition not suited to young girls. A committee waited on the unlucky
      professor to beg him to be more prudent for the future. He even lost, in
      consequence of Jacqueline&rsquo;s success, one of his pupils (the most stupid
      one, be it said, in the class), whose mother took her away, saying, with
      indignation, &ldquo;One might as well risk the things they are teaching at the
      Sorbonne!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This literary incident greatly alarmed Madame de Nailles! Of all things
      she dreaded that her daughter should early become dreamy and romantic. But
      on this point Jacqueline&rsquo;s behavior was calculated to reassure her. She
      laughed about her composition, she frolicked like a six-year-old child;
      without any apparent cause, she grew gayer and gayer as the time
      approached for the execution of her plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening before the day fixed on for the first sitting, Modeste, the
      elderly maid of the first Madame de Nailles, who loved her daughter, whom
      she had known from the moment of her birth, as if she had been her own
      foster-child, arrived at the studio of Hubert Marien in the Rue de Prony,
      bearing a box which she said contained all that would be wanted by
      Mademoiselle. Marien had the curiosity to look into it. It contained a
      robe of oriental muslin, light as air, diaphanous&mdash;and so dazzlingly
      white that he remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will look like a fly in milk in that thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied Modeste, with a laugh of satisfaction, &ldquo;it is very becoming
      to her. I altered it to fit her, for it is one of Madame&rsquo;s dresses.
      Mademoiselle has nothing but short skirts, and she wanted to be painted as
      a young lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the approval of her papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course, Monsieur, Monsieur le Baron gave his consent. But for
      that I certainly should not have minded what the child said to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; replied Marien, &ldquo;I can say nothing,&rdquo; and he made ready for his
      sitter the next day, by turning two or three studies of the nude, which
      might have shocked her, with their faces to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      A foreign language can not be properly acquired unless the learner has
      great opportunities for conversation. It therefore became a fixed habit
      with Fraulein Schult and Jacqueline to keep up a lively stream of talk
      during their walks, and their discourse was not always about the rain, the
      fine weather, the things displayed in the shop-windows, nor the historical
      monuments of Paris, which they visited conscientiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is near the heart is sure to come eventually to the surface in
      continual tete-a-tete intercourse. Fraulein Schult, who was of a
      sentimental temperament, in spite of her outward resemblance to a
      grenadier, was very willing to allow her companion to draw from her
      confessions relating to an intended husband, who was awaiting her at
      Berne, and whose letters, both in prose and verse, were her comfort in her
      exile. This future husband was an apothecary, and the idea that he pounded
      out verses as he pounded his drugs in a mortar, and rolled out rhymes with
      his pills, sometimes inclined Jacqueline to laugh, but she listened
      patiently to the plaintive outpourings of her &lsquo;promeneuse&rsquo;, because she
      wished to acquire a right to reciprocate by a few half-confidences of her
      own. In her turn, therefore, she confided to Fraulein Schult&mdash;moved
      much as Midas had been, when for his own relief he whispered to the reeds&mdash;that
      if she were sometimes idle, inattentive, &ldquo;away off in the moon,&rdquo; as her
      instructors told her by way of reproach, it was caused by one ever-present
      idea, which, ever since she had been able to think or feel, had taken
      possession of her inmost being&mdash;the idea of being loved some day by
      somebody as she herself loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that somebody a boy of her own age?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, fie!&mdash;mere boys&mdash;still schoolboys&mdash;could only be looked
      upon as playfellows or comrades. Of course she considered Fred&mdash;Fred,
      for example!&mdash;Frederic d&rsquo;Argy&mdash;as a brother, but how different
      he was from her ideal. Even young men of fashion&mdash;she had seen some
      of them on Tuesdays&mdash;Raoul Wermant, the one who so distinguished
      himself as a leader in the &lsquo;german&rsquo;, or Yvonne&rsquo;s brother, the officer of
      chasseurs, who had gained the prize for horsemanship, and others besides
      these&mdash;seemed to her very commonplace by comparison. No!&mdash;he
      whom she loved was a man in the prime of life, well known to fame. She
      didn&rsquo;t care if he had a few white hairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he a person of rank?&rdquo; asked Fraulein Schult, much puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if you mean of noble birth, no, not at all. But fame is so superior
      to birth! There are more ways than one of acquiring an illustrious name,
      and the name that a man makes for himself is the noblest of all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Jacqueline begged Fraulein Schult to imagine something like the
      passion of Bettina for Goethe&mdash;Fraulein Schult having told her that
      story simply with a view of interesting her in German conversation only
      the great man whose name she would not tell was not nearly so old as
      Goethe, and she herself was much less childish than Bettina. But, above
      all, it was his genius that attracted her&mdash;though his face, too, was
      very pleasing. And she went on to describe his appearance&mdash;till
      suddenly she stopped, burning with indignation; for she perceived that,
      notwithstanding the minuteness of her description, what she said was
      conveying an idea of ugliness and not one of the manly beauty she intended
      to portray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not like that at all,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;He has such a beautiful smile-a
      smile like no other I ever saw. And his talk is so amusing&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
       here Jacqueline lowered her voice as if afraid to be overheard, &ldquo;and I do
      think&mdash;I think, after all, he does love me&mdash;just a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On what could she have founded such a notion? Good heaven!&mdash;it was on
      something that had at first deeply grieved her, a sudden coldness and
      reserve that had come over his manner to her. Not long before she had read
      an English novel (no others were allowed to come into her hands). It was
      rather a stupid book, with many tedious passages, but in it she was told
      how the high-minded hero, not being able, for grave reasons, to aspire to
      the hand of the heroine, had taken refuge in an icy coldness, much as it
      cost him, and as soon as possible had gone away. English novels are
      nothing if not moral.
    </p>
    <p>
      This story, not otherwise interesting, threw a gleam of light on what, up
      to that time, had been inexplicable to Jacqueline. He was above all things
      a man of honor. He must have perceived that his presence troubled her. He
      had possibly seen her when she stole a half-burned cigarette which he had
      left upon the table, a prize she had laid up with other relics&mdash;an
      old glove that he had lost, a bunch of violets he had gathered for her in
      the country. Yes! When she came to think of it, she felt certain he must
      have seen her furtively lay her hand upon that cigarette; that cigarette
      had compromised her. Then it was he must have said to himself that it was
      due to her parents, who had always shown him kindness, to surmount an
      attachment that could come to nothing&mdash;nothing at present. But when
      she should be old enough for him to ask her hand, would he dare? Might he
      not rashly think himself too old? She must seek out some way to give him
      encouragement, to give him to understand that she was not, after all, so
      far&mdash;so very far from being a young lady&mdash;old enough to be
      married. How difficult it all was! All the more difficult because she was
      exceedingly afraid of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not surprising that Fraulein Schult, after listening day after day
      to such recitals, with all the alternations of hope and of discouragement
      which succeeded one another in the mind of her precocious pupil, guessed,
      the moment that Jacqueline came to her, in a transport of joy, to ask her
      to go with her to the Rue de Prony, that the hero of the mysterious
      love-story was no other than Hubert Marien.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she understood this, she perceived that she should be placed in
      a very false position. But she thought to herself there was no possible
      way of getting out of it, without giving a great deal too much importance
      to a very innocent piece of childish folly; she therefore determined to
      say nothing about it, but to keep a strict watch in the mean time. After
      all, M. de Nailles himself had given her her orders. She was to accompany
      Jacqueline, and do her crochet-work in one corner of the studio as long as
      the sitting lasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      All she could do was to obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And above all not a word to mamma, whatever she may ask you,&rdquo; said
      Jacqueline.
    </p>
    <p>
      And her father added, with a laugh, &ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo; Fraulein Schult felt
      that she knew what was expected of her. She was naturally compliant, and
      above all things she was anxious to get paid for as many hours of her time
      as possible&mdash;much like the driver of a fiacre, because the more money
      she could make the sooner she would be in a position to espouse her
      apothecary.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jacqueline, escorted by her Swiss duenna, penetrated almost furtively
      into Marien&rsquo;s studio, her heart beat as if she had a consciousness of
      doing something very wrong. In truth, she had pictured to herself so many
      impossible scenes beforehand, had rehearsed the probable questions and
      answers in so many strange dialogues, had soothed her fancy with so many
      extravagant ideas, that she had at last created, bit by bit, a situation
      very different from the reality, and then threw herself into it, body and
      soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The look of the atelier&mdash;the first she had ever been in in her life&mdash;disappointed
      her. She had expected to behold a gorgeous collection of bric-a-brac,
      according to accounts she had heard of the studios of several celebrated
      masters. That of Marien was remarkable only for its vast dimensions and
      its abundance of light. Studies and sketches hung on the walls, were piled
      one over another in corners, were scattered about everywhere, attesting
      the incessant industry of the artist, whose devotion to his calling was so
      great that his own work never satisfied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only some interesting casts from antique bronzes, brought out into strong
      relief by a background of tapestry, adorned this lofty hall, which had
      none of that confusion of decorative objects, in the midst of which some
      modern artists seem to pose themselves rather than to labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fresh canvas stood upon an easel, all ready for the sitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, we will lose no time,&rdquo; said Marien, rather roughly, seeing
      that Jacqueline was about to explore all the corners of his apartment, and
      that at that moment, with the tips of her fingers, she was drawing aside
      the covering he had cast over his Death of Savonarola, the picture he was
      then at work upon. It was not the least of his grudges against Jacqueline
      for insisting on having her portrait painted that it obliged him to lay
      aside this really great work, that he might paint a likeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In ten minutes I shall be ready,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, obediently taking off
      her hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you stay as you are? That jacket suits you. Let us begin
      immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed! What a horrid suggestion!&rdquo; she cried, running up to the box
      which was half open. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see how much better I can look in a moment or
      two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I put no faith in your fancies about your toilette. I certainly don&rsquo;t
      promise to accept them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, he left her alone with her Bernese governess, saying: &ldquo;Call
      me when you are ready, I shall be in the next room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour, and more, passed, and no signal had been given.
      Marien, getting out of patience, knocked on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you nearly done beautifying yourself?&rdquo; he asked, in a tone of irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just done,&rdquo; replied a low voice, which trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went in, and to the great amusement of Fraulein Schult, who was not too
      preoccupied to notice everything, he stood confounded&mdash;petrified, as
      a man might be by some work of magic. What had become of Jacqueline? What
      had she in common with that dazzling vision? Had she been touched by some
      fairy&rsquo;s wand? Or, to accomplish such a transformation, had nothing been
      needed but the substitution of a woman&rsquo;s dress, fitted to her person, for
      the short skirts and loose waists cut in a boyish fashion, which had made
      the little girl seem hardly to belong to any sex, an indefinite being,
      condemned, as it were, to childishness? How tall, and slender, and
      graceful she looked in that long gown, the folds of which fell from her
      waist in flowing lines, a waist as round and flexible as the branch of a
      willow; what elegance there was in her modest corsage, which displayed for
      the first time her lovely arms and neck, half afraid of their own
      exposure. She still was not robust, but the leanness that she herself had
      owned to was not brought into prominence by any bone or angle, her dark
      skin was soft and polished, the color of ancient statues which have been
      slightly tinted yellow by exposure to the sun. This girl, a Parisienne,
      seemed formed on the model of a figurine of Tanagra. Greek, too, was her
      small head, crowned only by her usual braid of hair, which she had simply
      gathered up so as to show the nape of her neck, which was perhaps the most
      beautiful thing in all her beautiful person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&mdash;what do you think of me?&rdquo; she said to Marien, with a
      searching glance to see how she impressed him&mdash;a glance strangely
      like that of a grown woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&mdash;I can&rsquo;t get over it!&mdash;Why have you bedizened yourself in
      that fashion?&rdquo; he asked, with an affectation of &lsquo;brusquerie&rsquo;, as he tried
      to recover his power of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t like me?&rdquo; she murmured, in a low voice. Tears came into
      her eyes; her lips trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see Jacqueline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I should hope not&mdash;but I am better than Jacqueline, am I
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am accustomed to Jacqueline. This new acquaintance disconcerts me. Give
      me time to get used to her. But once again let me ask, what possessed you
      to disguise yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not disguised. I am disguised when I am forced to wear those things,
      which do not suit me,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, pointing to her gray jacket and
      plaid skirt which were hung up on a hat-rack. &ldquo;Oh, I know why mamma keeps
      me like that&mdash;she is afraid I should get too fond of dress before I
      have finished my education, and that my mind may be diverted from serious
      subjects. It is no doubt all intended for my good, but I should not lose
      much time if I turned up my hair like this, and what harm could there be
      in lengthening my skirts an inch or two? My picture will show her that I
      am improved by such little changes, and perhaps it will induce hor to let
      me go to the Bal Blanc that Madame d&rsquo;Etaples is going to give on Yvonne&rsquo;s
      birthday. Mamma declined for me, saying I was not fit to wear a low-necked
      corsage, but you see she was mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; said Marien, smiling in spite of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; she went on, delighted at his look. &ldquo;Of course, I
      have bones, but they don&rsquo;t show like the great hollows under the
      collar-bones that Dolly shows, for instance&mdash;but Dolly looks stouter
      than I because her face is so round. Well! Dolly is going to Madame
      d&rsquo;Etaples&rsquo;s ball.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grant,&rdquo; said Marien, devoting all his attention to the preparation of
      his palette, that she might not see him laugh, &ldquo;I grant that you have
      bones&mdash;yes, many bones&mdash;but they are not much seen because they
      are too well placed to be obtrusive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad of that,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But let me ask you one question. Where did you pick up that queer gown?
      It seems to me that I have seen it somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt you have,&rdquo; replied Jacqueline, who had quite recovered from her
      first shock, and was now ready to talk; &ldquo;it is the dress mamma had made
      some time ago when she acted in a comedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I thought,&rdquo; growled Marien, biting his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dress recalled to his mind many personal recollections, and for one
      instant he paused. Madame de Nailles, among other talents, possessed that
      of amateur acting. On one occasion, several years before, she had asked
      his advice concerning what dress she should wear in a little play of
      Scribe&rsquo;s, which was to be given at the house of Madame d&rsquo;Avrigny&mdash;the
      house in all Paris most addicted to private theatricals. This reproduction
      of a forgotten play, with its characters attired in the costume of the
      period in which the play was placed, had had great success, a success due
      largely to the excellence of the costumes. In the comic parts the dressing
      had been purposely exaggerated, but Madame de Nailles, who played the part
      of a great coquette, would not have been dressed in character had she not
      tried to make herself as bewitching as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marien had shown her pictures of the beauties of 1840, painted by Dubufe,
      and she had decided on a white gauze embroidered with gold, in which, on
      that memorable evening, she had captured more than one heart, and which
      had had its influence on the life and destiny of Marien. This might have
      been seen in the vague glance of indignation with which he now regarded
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;was it half so pretty when worn by Madame de Nailles
      as by her stepdaughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline meantime went on talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must know&mdash;I was rather perplexed what to do&mdash;almost all
      mamma&rsquo;s gowns made me look horribly too old. Modeste tried them on me one
      after another. We burst out laughing, they seemed so absurd. And then we
      were afraid mamma might chance to want the one I took. This old thing it
      was not likely she would ask for. She had worn it only once, and then put
      it away. The gauze is a little yellow from lying by, don&rsquo;t you think so?
      But we asked my father, who said it was all right, that I should look less
      dark in it, and that the dress was of no particular date, which was always
      an advantage. These Grecian dresses are always in the fashion. Ah! four
      years ago mamma was much more slender than she is now. But we have taken
      it in&mdash;oh! we took it in a great deal under the arms, but we had to
      let it down. Would you believe it?&mdash;I am taller than mamma&mdash;but
      you can hardly see the seam, it is concealed by the gold embroidery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter for that. We shall only take a three-quarters&rsquo; length,&rdquo; said
      Marien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what a pity! No one will see I have a long skirt on. But I shall be
      &lsquo;decolletee&rsquo;, at any rate. I shall wear a comb. No one would know the
      picture for me&mdash;nobody!&mdash;You yourself hardly knew me&mdash;did
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at first sight. You are much altered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma will be amazed,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, clasping her hands. &ldquo;It was a
      good idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amazed, I do not doubt,&rdquo; said Marien, somewhat anxiously. &ldquo;But suppose we
      take our pose&mdash;Stay!&mdash;keep just as you are. Your hands before
      you, hanging down&mdash;so. Your fingers loosely clasped&mdash;that&rsquo;s it.
      Turn your head a little. What a lovely neck!&mdash;how well her head is
      set upon it!&rdquo; he cried, involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline glanced at Fraulein Schult, who was at the farther end of the
      studio, busy with her crochet. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said the look, &ldquo;that he has
      found out I am pretty&mdash;that I am worth something&mdash;all the rest
      will soon happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, while Marien was sketching in the graceful figure that posed before
      him, Jacqueline&rsquo;s imagination was investing it with the white robe of a
      bride. She had a vision of the painter growing more and more resolved to
      ask her hand in marriage as the portrait grew beneath his brush; of
      course, her father would say at first: &ldquo;You are mad&mdash;you must wait. I
      shall not let Jacqueline marry till she is seventeen.&rdquo; But long
      engagements, she had heard, had great delights, though in France they are
      not the fashion. At last, after being long entreated, she was sure that M.
      and Madame de Nailles would end by giving their consent&mdash;they were so
      fond of Marien. Standing there, dreaming this dream, which gave her face
      an expression of extreme happiness, Jacqueline made a most admirable
      model. She had not felt in the least fatigued when Marien at last said to
      her, apologetically: &ldquo;You must be ready to drop&mdash;I forgot you were
      not made of wood; we will go on to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline, having put on her gray jacket with as much contempt for it as
      Cinderella may have felt for her rags after her successes at the ball,
      departed with the delightful sensation of having made a bold first step,
      and being eager to make another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was with all her sittings, though some left her anxious and
      unhappy, as for instance when Marien, absorbed in his work, had not
      paused, except to say, &ldquo;Turn your head a little&mdash;you are losing the
      pose.&rdquo; Or else, &ldquo;Now you may rest for today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On such occasions she would watch him anxiously as he painted swiftly, his
      brush making great splashes on the canvas, his dark features wearing a
      scowl, his chin on his breast, a deep frown upon his forehead, on which
      the hair grew low. It was evident that at such times he had no thought of
      pleasing her. Little did she suspect that he was saying to himself: &ldquo;Fool
      that I am!&mdash;A man of my age to take pleasure in seeing that little
      head filled with follies and fancies of which I am the object. But can one&mdash;let
      one be ever so old&mdash;always act&mdash;or think reasonably? You are
      mad, Marien! A child of fourteen! Bah!&mdash;they make her out to be
      fourteen&mdash;but she is fifteen&mdash;and was not that the age of
      Juliet? But, you old graybeard, you are not Romeo!&mdash;&lsquo;Ma foi&rsquo;! I am in
      a pretty scrape. It ought to teach me not to play with fire at my age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those words &ldquo;at my age&rdquo; were the refrain to all the reflections of Hubert
      Marien. He had seen enough in his relations with women to have no doubt
      about Jacqueline&rsquo;s feelings, of which indeed he had watched the rise and
      progress from the time she had first begun to conceive a passion for him,
      with a mixture of amusement and conceit. The most cautious of men are not
      insensible to flattery, whatever form it may take. To be fallen in love
      with by a child was no doubt absurd&mdash;a thing to be laughed at&mdash;but
      Jacqueline seemed no longer a child, since for him she had uncovered her
      young shoulders and arranged her dark hair on her head with the effect of
      a queenly diadem. Not only had her dawning loveliness been revealed to him
      alone, but to him it seemed that he had helped to make her lovely. The
      innocent tenderness she felt for him had accomplished this miracle. Why
      should he refuse to inhale an incense so pure, so genuine? How could he
      help being sensible to its fragrance? Would it not be in his power to put
      an end to the whole affair whenever he pleased? But till then might he not
      bask in it, as one does in a warm ray of spring sunshine? He put aside,
      therefore, all scruples. And when he did this Jacqueline with rapture saw
      the painter&rsquo;s face, no longer with its scowl, but softened by some secret
      influence, the lines smoothed from his brow, while the beautiful smile
      which had fascinated so many women passed like a ray of light over his
      expressive mobile features; then she would once more fancy that he was
      making love to her, and indeed he said many things, which, without rousing
      in himself any scruples of conscience, or alarming the propriety of
      Fraulein Schult, were well calculated to delude a girl who had had no
      experience, and who was charmed by the illusions of a love-affair, as she
      might have been by a fairy-story.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that sometimes, when he fancied he might have gone too far,
      Marien would grow sarcastic, or stay silent for a time. But this change of
      behavior produced on Jacqueline only the same effect that the caprices of
      a coquette produce upon a very young admirer. She grew anxious, she wanted
      to find out the reason, and finally found some explanation or excuse for
      him that coincided with her fancies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing that reassured her in such cases was her picture. If she could
      seem to him as beautiful as he had made her look on canvas she was sure
      that he must love her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this really I? Are you sure?&rdquo; she said to Marien with a laugh of
      delight. &ldquo;It seems to me that you have made me too handsome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have hardly done you justice,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It is not my fault if you
      are more beautiful than seems natural, like the beauties in the keepsakes.
      By the way, I hold those English things in horror. What do you say of
      them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Jacqueline undertook to defend the keepsake beauties with animation,
      declaring that no one but a hopelessly realistic painter would refuse to
      do justice to those charming monstrosities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; thought Marien, &ldquo;if she is adding a quick wit to her other
      charms&mdash;that will put the finishing stroke to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the portrait was sufficiently advanced, M. de Nailles came to the
      studio to judge of the likeness. He was delighted: &ldquo;Only, my friend, I
      think,&rdquo; he cried to Marien, endeavoring to soften his one objection to the
      picture, &ldquo;that you have given her a look&mdash;how can I put it?&mdash;an
      expression very charming no doubt, but which is not that of a child of her
      age. You know what I mean. It is something tender&mdash;intense&mdash;profound,
      too feminine. It may come to her some day, perhaps&mdash;but hitherto
      Jacqueline&rsquo;s expression has been generally that of a merry, mischievous
      child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, papa!&rdquo; cried the young girl, stung by the insult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may possibly be right,&rdquo; Marien hastened to reply, &ldquo;it was probably
      the fatigue of posing that gave her that expression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; repeated Jacqueline, more shocked than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can alter it,&rdquo; said the painter, much amused by her extreme despair.
      But Marien thought that Jacqueline had not in the least that precocious
      air which her father attributed to her, when standing before him she gave
      herself up to thoughts the current of which he followed easily, watching
      on her candid face its changes of expression. How could he have painted
      her other than she appeared to him? Was what he saw an apparition&mdash;or
      was it a work of magic?
    </p>
    <p>
      Several times during the sittings M. de Nailles made his appearance in the
      studio, and after greatly praising the work, persisted in his objection
      that it made Jacqueline too old. But since the painter saw her thus they
      must accept his judgment. It was no doubt an effect of the grown-up
      costume that she had had a fancy to put on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he said to Jacqueline, &ldquo;it is of not much consequence; you
      will grow up to it some of these days. And I pay you my compliments in
      advance on your appearance in the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt like choking with rage. &ldquo;Oh! is it right,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;for
      parents to persist in keeping a young girl forever in her cradle, so to
      speak?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. A DANGEROUS MODEL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Time passed too quickly to please Jacqueline. Her portrait was finished at
      last, notwithstanding the willingness Marien had shown&mdash;or so it
      seemed to her&mdash;to retouch it unnecessarily that she might again and
      again come back to his atelier. But it was done at last. She glided into
      that dear atelier for the last time, her heart big with regret, with no
      hope that she would ever again put on the fairy robe which had, she
      thought, transfigured her till she was no longer little Jacqueline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you only for one moment, and I need only your face,&rdquo; said Marien.
      &ldquo;I want to change&mdash;a line&mdash;I hardly know what to call it, at the
      corner of your mouth. Your father is right; your mouth is too grave. Think
      of something amusing&mdash;of the Bal Blanc at Madame d&rsquo;Etaples, or
      merely, if you like, of the satisfaction it will give you to be done with
      these everlasting sittings&mdash;to be no longer obliged to bear the
      burden of a secret, in short to get rid of your portrait-painter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made him no answer, not daring to trust her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! now, on the contrary you are tightening your lips,&rdquo; said Marien,
      continuing to play with her as a cat plays with a mouse&mdash;provided
      there ever was a cat who, while playing with its mouse, had no intention
      of crunching it. &ldquo;You are not merry, you are sad. That is not at all
      becoming to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you attribute to me your own thoughts? It is you who will be glad
      to get rid of all this trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fraulein Schult, who, while patiently adding stitch after stitch to the
      long strip of her crochet-work, was often much amused by the dialogues
      between sitter and painter, pricked up her ears to hear what a Frenchman
      would say to what was evidently intended to provoke a compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I shall miss you very much,&rdquo; said Marien, quite simply;
      &ldquo;I have grown accustomed to see you here. You have become one of the
      familiar objects of my studio. Your absence will create a void.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About as much as if this or that were gone,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, in a hurt
      tone, pointing first to a Japanese bronze and then to an Etruscan vase;
      &ldquo;with only this difference, that you care least for the living object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are bitter, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you make me such provoking answers, Monsieur. My feeling is
      different,&rdquo; she went on impetuously, &ldquo;I could pass my whole life watching
      you paint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would get tired of it probably in the long run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she cried, blushing a deep red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you would have to put up with my pipe&mdash;that big pipe yonder&mdash;a
      horror.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like it,&rdquo; she cried, with conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you would not like my bad temper. If you knew how ill I can behave
      sometimes! I can scold, I can become unbearable, when this, for example,&rdquo;
       here he pointed with his mahlstick to the Savonarola, &ldquo;does not please
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is beautiful&mdash;so beautiful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is detestable. I shall have to go back some day and renew my
      impressions of Florence&mdash;see once more the Piazze of the Signora and
      San Marco&mdash;and then I shall begin my picture all over again. Let us
      go together&mdash;will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, fervently, &ldquo;think of seeing Italy!&mdash;and with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might not be so great a pleasure as you think. Nothing is such a bore
      as to travel with people who are pervaded by one idea, and my &lsquo;idee fixe&rsquo; 
      is my picture&mdash;my great Dominican. He has taken complete possession
      of me&mdash;he overshadows me. I can think of nothing but him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but you think of me sometimes, I suppose,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, softly,
      &ldquo;for I share your time with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think of you to blame you for taking me away from the fifteenth
      century,&rdquo; replied Hubert Marien, half seriously. &ldquo;Ouf!&mdash;There! it is
      done at last. That dimple I never could manage I have got in for better or
      for worse. Now you may fly off. I set you at liberty&mdash;you poor little
      thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed in no hurry to profit by his permission. She stood perfectly
      still in the middle of the studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I have posed well, faithfully, and with docility all these
      weeks?&rdquo; she asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give you a certificate to that effect, if you like. No one could
      have done better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if the certificate is not all I want, will you give me some other
      present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A beautiful portrait&mdash;what can you want more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The picture is for mamma. I ask a favor on my own account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I refuse it beforehand. But you can tell me what it is, all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&mdash;the only part of your house that I have ever been in is
      this atelier. You can imagine I have a curiosity to see the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see! you threaten me with a domiciliary visit without warning. Well!
      certainly, if that would give you any amusement. But my house contains
      nothing wonderful. I tell you that beforehand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One likes to know how one&rsquo;s friends look at home&mdash;in their own
      setting, and I have only seen you here at work in your atelier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best point of view, believe me. But I am ready to do your bidding. Do
      you wish to see where I eat my dinner?&rdquo; asked Marien, as he took her down
      the staircase leading to his dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fraulein Schult would have liked to go with them&mdash;it was, besides,
      her duty. But she had not been asked to fulfil it. She hesitated a moment,
      and in that moment Jacqueline had disappeared. After consideration, the
      &lsquo;promeneuse&rsquo; went on with her crochet, with a shrug of her shoulders which
      meant: &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t come to much harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seated in the studio, she heard the sound of their voices on the floor
      below. Jacqueline was lingering in the fencing-room where Marien was in
      the habit of counteracting by athletic exercises the effects of a too
      sedentary life. She was amusing herself by fingering the dumb-bells and
      the foils; she lingered long before some precious suits of armor. Then she
      was taken up into a small room, communicating with the atelier, where
      there was a fine collection of drawings by the old masters. &ldquo;My only
      luxury,&rdquo; said Marien.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Schult, getting impatient, began to roll up yards and yards
      of crochet, and coughed, by way of a signal, but remembering how
      disagreeable it would have been to herself to be interrupted in a
      tete-a-tete with her apothecary, she thought it not worth while to disturb
      them in these last moments. M. de Nailles&rsquo;s orders had been that she was
      to sit in the atelier. So she continued to sit there, doing what she had
      been told to do without any qualms of conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Marien had shown Jacqueline all his drawings he asked her: &ldquo;Are you
      satisfied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Jacqueline&rsquo;s hand was already on the portiere which separated the
      little room from Marien&rsquo;s bedchamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I beg pardon,&rdquo; she exclaimed, pausing on the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would think you would like to see me asleep,&rdquo; said Marien with some
      little embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never should have thought your bedroom would have been so pretty. Why,
      it is as elegant as a lady&rsquo;s chamber,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, slipping into it
      as she spoke, with an exciting consciousness of doing something she ought
      not to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an insult, when I thought all my tastes were simple and severe,&rdquo; he
      replied; but he had not followed her into the chamber, withheld by an
      impulse of modesty men sometimes feel, when innocence is led into audacity
      through ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What lovely flowers you have!&rdquo; said Jacqueline, from within. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they
      make your head ache?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take them out at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know that men liked, as we do, to be surrounded by flowers.
      Won&rsquo;t you give me one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! one pink will be enough for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then take it,&rdquo; said Marien; her curiosity alarmed him, and he was anxious
      to get her away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it not be nicer if you gave it me yourself?&rdquo; she replied, with
      reproach in her tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is one, Mademoiselle. And now I must tell you that I want to dress.
      I have to go out immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pinned the pink into her bodice so high that she could inhale its
      perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon. Thank you, and good-by,&rdquo; she said, extending her hand
      to him with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Au revoir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;&lsquo;au revoir&rsquo; at home&mdash;but that will not be like here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she stood there before him there came into her eyes a strange
      expression, to which, without exactly knowing why, he replied by pressing
      his lips fervently on the little hand he was still holding in his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very often since her infancy he had kissed her before witnesses, but this
      time she gave a little cry, and turned as white as the flower whose petals
      were touching her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marien started back alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; he said in a tone that he endeavored to make careless&mdash;but
      in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though she was much agitated herself she failed not to remark his emotion,
      and on the threshold of the atelier, she blew a kiss back to him from the
      tips of her gloved fingers, without speaking or smiling. Then she went
      back to Fraulein Schult, who was still sitting in the place where she had
      left her, and said: &ldquo;Let us go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next time Madame de Nailles saw her stepdaughter she was dazzled by a
      radiant look in her young face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened to you?&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;you look triumphant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I have good reason to triumph,&rdquo; said Jacqueline. &ldquo;I think that
      I have won a victory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so? Over yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed&mdash;victories over one&rsquo;s self give us the comfort of a good
      conscience, but they do not make us gay&mdash;as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then tell me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-no! I can not tell you yet. I must be silent two days more,&rdquo; said
      Jacqueline, throwing herself into her mother&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Nailles asked no more questions, but she looked at her
      stepdaughter with an air of great surprise. For some weeks past she had
      had no pleasure in looking at Jacqueline. She began to be aware that near
      her, at her side, an exquisite butterfly was about for the first time to
      spread its wings&mdash;wings of a radiant loveliness, which, when they
      fluttered in the air, would turn all eyes away from other butterflies,
      which had lost some of their freshness during the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      A difficult task was before her. How could she keep this too precocious
      insect in its chrysalis state? How could she shut it up in its dark cocoon
      and retard its transformation?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacqueline,&rdquo; she said, and the tones of her voice were less soft than
      those in which she usually addressed her, &ldquo;it seems to me that you are
      wasting your time a great deal. You hardly practise at all; you do almost
      nothing at the &lsquo;cours&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t know what can be distracting your
      attention from your lessons, but I have received complaints which should
      make a great girl like you ashamed of herself. Do you know what I am
      beginning to think?&mdash;That Madame de Monredon&rsquo;s system of education
      has done better than mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! mamma, you can&rsquo;t be thinking of sending me to a convent!&rdquo; cried
      Jacqueline, in tones of comic despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say that&mdash;but I really think it might be good for you to
      make a retreat where your cousin Giselle is, instead of plunging into
      follies which interrupt your progress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call Madame d&rsquo;Etaples&rsquo;s &lsquo;bal blanc&rsquo; a folly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly will not go to it&mdash;that is settled,&rdquo; said the young
      stepmother, dryly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. SURPRISES
    </h2>
    <p>
      In all other ways Madame de Nailles did her best to assist in the success
      of the surprise. On the second of June, the eve of Ste.-Clotilde&rsquo;s day,
      she went out, leaving every opportunity for the grand plot to mature. Had
      she not absented herself in like manner the year before at the same date&mdash;thus
      enabling an upholsterer to drape artistically her little salon with
      beautiful thick silk tapestries which had just been imported from the
      East? Her idea was that this year she might find a certain lacquered
      screen which she coveted. The Baroness belonged to her period; she liked
      Japanese things. But, alas! the charming object that awaited her, with a
      curtain hung over it to prolong the suspense, had nothing Japanese about
      it whatever. Madame de Nailles received the good wishes of her family,
      responded to them with all proper cordiality, and then was dragged up
      joyously to a picture hanging on the wall of her room, but still concealed
      under the cloth that covered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good of you!&rdquo; she said, with all confidence to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a picture by Marien!&mdash;A portrait by Marien! A likeness of
      Jacqueline!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he uncovered the masterpiece of the great artist, expecting to be
      joyous in the joy with which she would receive it. But something strange
      occurred. Madame de Nailles sprang back a step or two, stretching out her
      arms as if repelling an apparition, her face was distorted, her head was
      turned away; then she dropped into the nearest seat and burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma!&mdash;dear little mamma!&mdash;what is it?&rdquo; cried Jacqueline,
      springing forward to kiss her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Nailles disengaged herself angrily from her embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me alone!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;let me alone!&mdash;How dared you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And impetuously, hardly restraining a gesture of horror and hate, she
      rushed into her own chamber. Thither her husband followed her, anxious and
      bewildered, and there he witnessed a nervous attack which ended in a
      torrent of reproaches:
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it possible that he had, not seen the impropriety of those sittings to
      Marien? Oh, yes! No doubt he was an old friend of the family, but that did
      not prevent all these deceptions, all these disguises, and all the other
      follies which he had sanctioned&mdash;he&mdash;Jacqueline&rsquo;s father!&mdash;from
      being very improper. Did he wish to take from her all authority over his
      child?&mdash;a girl who was already too much disposed to emancipate
      herself. Her own efforts had all been directed to curb this alarming
      propensity&mdash;yes, alarming&mdash;alarming for the future. And all in
      vain! There was no use in saying more. &lsquo;Mon Dieu&rsquo;! had he no trust in her
      devotion to his child, in her prudence and her foresight, that he must
      thwart her thus? And she had always imagined that for ten years she had
      faithfully fulfilled a mother&rsquo;s duties! What ingratitude from every one!
      Mademoiselle Schult should be sent away at once. Jacqueline should go to a
      convent. They would break off all intercourse with Marien. They had
      conspired against her&mdash;every one.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she wept more bitterly than ever&mdash;tears of rage, salt tears
      which rubbed the powder off her cheeks and disfigured the face that had
      remained beautiful by her power of will and self-control. But now the
      disorder of her nerves got the better of precautions. The blonde angel,
      whose beauty was on the wane, was transformed into a fury. Her
      six-and-thirty years were fully apparent, her complexion appeared slightly
      blotched, all her defects were obtrusive in contrast with the precocious
      development of beauty in Jacqueline. She was firmly resolved that her
      stepdaughter&rsquo;s obtrusive womanhood should remain in obscurity a very much
      longer time, under pretence that Jacqueline was still a child. She was a
      child, at any rate! The portrait was a lie! an imposture! an affront! an
      outrage!
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime M. de Nailles, almost beside himself, fancied at first that his
      wife was going mad, but in the midst of her sobs and reproaches he managed
      to discover that he had somehow done her wrong, and when, with a broken
      voice, she cried, &ldquo;You no longer love me!&rdquo; he did not know what to do to
      prove how bitterly he repented having grieved her. He stammered, he made
      excuses, he owned that he had been to blame, that he had been very stupid,
      and he begged her pardon. As to the portrait, it should be taken from the
      salon, where, if seen, it might become a pretext for foolish compliments
      to Jacqueline. Why not send it at once to Grandchaux? In short, he would
      do anything she wished, provided she would leave off crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Madame de Nailles continued to weep. Her husband was forced at last to
      leave her and to return to Jacqueline, who stood petrified in the salon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your mamma is right. We have made a deplorable mistake in
      what we have done. Besides, you must know that this unlucky picture is not
      in the least like you. Marien has made some use of your features to paint
      a fancy portrait&mdash;so we will let nobody see it. They might laugh at
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this way he hoped to repair the evil he had done in flattering his
      daughter&rsquo;s vanity, and promoting that dangerous spirit of independence,
      denounced to him a few minutes before, but of which, up to that time, he
      had never heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline, in her turn, began to sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle Schult had cause, too, to wipe her eyes, pretending a more or
      less sincere repentance for her share in the deception. Vigorously
      cross-questioned by Madame de Nailles, who called upon her to tell all she
      knew, under pain of being dismissed immediately, she saw but one way of
      retaining her situation, which was to deliver up Jacqueline, bound hand
      and foot, to the anger of her stepmother, by telling all she knew of the
      childish romance of which she had been the confidante. As a reward she was
      permitted (as she had foreseen) to retain her place in the character of a
      spy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sad Ste.-Clotilde&rsquo;s day that year. Marien, who came in the
      evening, heard with surprise that the Baroness was indisposed and could
      see no one. For twelve days after this he continued in disgrace, being
      refused admittance when he called. Those twelve days were days of anguish
      for Jacqueline. To see Marien no longer, to be treated with coldness by
      her father, to see in the blue eyes of her stepmother&mdash;eyes so soft
      and tender when they looked upon her hitherto&mdash;only a harsh,
      mistrustful glare, almost a look of hatred, was a punishment greater than
      she could bear. What had she done to deserve punishment? Of what was she
      accused? She spoke of her wretchedness to Fraulein Schult, who,
      perfidiously, day after day, drew from her something to report to Madame
      de Nailles. That lady was somewhat consoled, while suffering tortures of
      jealousy, to know that the girl to whom these sufferings were due was
      paying dearly for her fault and was very unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the twelfth day something occurred which, though it made no noise in
      the household, had very serious consequences. The effect it produced on
      Jacqueline was decisive and deplorable. The poor child, after going
      through all the states of mind endured by those who suffer under unmerited
      disgrace&mdash;revolt, indignation, sulkiness, silent obstinacy&mdash;felt
      unable to bear it longer. She resolved to humble herself, hoping that by
      so doing the wall of ice that had arisen between her stepmother and
      herself might be cast down. By this time she cared less to know of what
      fault she was supposed to be guilty than to be taken back into favor as
      before. What must she do to obtain forgiveness? Explanations are usually
      worthless; besides, none might be granted her. She remembered that when
      she was a small child she had obtained immediate oblivion of any fault by
      throwing herself impulsively into the arms of her little mamma, and asking
      her to forget whatever she had done to displease her, for she had not done
      it on purpose. She would do the same thing now. Putting aside all pride
      and obstinacy, she would go to this mamma, who, for some days, had seemed
      so different. She would smother her in kisses. She might possibly be
      repelled at first. She would not mind it. She was sure that in the end she
      would be forgiven.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was this resolution formed than she hastened to put it into
      execution. It was the time of day when Madame de Nailles was usually
      alone. Jacqueline went to her bedchamber, but she was not there, and a
      moment after she stood on the threshold of the little salon. There she
      stopped short, not quite certain how she should proceed, asking herself
      what would be her reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How shall I do it?&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;How had I better do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; she answered these doubts. &ldquo;It will be very easy. I will go in on
      tiptoe, so that she can&rsquo;t hear me. I will slip behind her chair, and I
      will hug her suddenly, so tight, so tenderly, and kiss her till she tells
      me that all has been forgiven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she thought thus Jacqueline noiselessly opened the door of the salon,
      over which, on the inner side, hung a thick plush &lsquo;portiere&rsquo;. But as she
      was about to lift it, the sound of a voice within made her stand
      motionless. She recognized the tones of Marien. He was pleading,
      imploring, interrupted now and then by the sharp and still angry voice of
      her mamma. They were not speaking above their breath, but if she listened
      she could hear them, and, without any scruples of conscience, she did
      listen intently, anxious to see her way through the dark fog in which, for
      twelve days, she had wandered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not go quite so far as that,&rdquo; said Madame de Nailles, dryly. &ldquo;It is
      enough for me that she produced an illusion of such beauty upon you. Now I
      know what to expect&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is nonsense,&rdquo; replied Marien&mdash;&ldquo;mere foolishness. You jealous!
      jealous of a baby whom I knew when she wore white pinafores, who has grown
      up under my very eyes? But, so far as I am concerned, she exists no
      longer. She is not, she never will be in my eyes, a woman. I shall think
      of her as playing with her doll, eating sugar-plums, and so on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline grew faint. She shivered and leaned against the door-post.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would not suppose so, to judge by the picture with which she has
      inspired you. You may say what you like, but I know that in all this there
      was a set purpose to insult me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clotilde!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place, on no pretext ought you to have been induced to paint
      her portrait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so? Consider, had I refused, the danger of awakening
      suspicion? I accepted the commission most unwillingly, much put out by it,
      as you may suppose. But you are making too much of an imaginary fault.
      Consign the wretched picture to the barn, if you like. We will never say
      another word about so foolish a matter. You promise me to forget it, won&rsquo;t
      you?... Dear! you will promise me?&rdquo; he added, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Nailles sighed and replied: &ldquo;If not she it will be some one
      else. I am very unhappy.... I am weak and contemptible....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clotilde!&rdquo; replied Marien, in an accent that went to Jacqueline&rsquo;s heart
      like a knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fancied that after this she heard the sound of a kiss, and, with her
      cheeks aflame and her head burning, she rushed away. She understood little
      of what she had overheard. She only realized that he had given her up,
      that he had turned her into ridicule, that he had said &ldquo;Clotilde!&rdquo; to her
      mother, that he had called her dear&mdash;she!&mdash;the woman she had so
      adored, so venerated, her best friend, her father&rsquo;s wife, her mother by
      adoption! Everything in this world seemed to be giving way under her feet.
      The world was full of falsehood and of treason, and life, so bad, so
      cruel, was no longer what she had supposed it to be. It had broken its
      promise to herself, it had made her bad&mdash;bad forever. She loved no
      one, she believed in no one. She wished she were dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      How she reached her own room in this state Jacqueline never knew. She was
      aware at last of being on her knees beside her bed, with her face hidden
      in the bed-clothes. She was biting them to stifle her desire to scream.
      Her hands were clenched convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;mamma!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was this a reproach addressed to her she had so long called by that name?
      Or was it an appeal, vibrating with remorse, to her real mother, so long
      forgotten in favor of this false idol, her rival, her enemy?
    </p>
    <p>
      Undoubtedly, Jacqueline was too innocent, too ignorant to guess the real
      truth from what she had overheard. But she had learned enough to be no
      longer the pure-minded young girl of a few hours before. It seemed to her
      as if a fetid swamp now lay before her, barring her entrance into life.
      Vague as her perceptions were, this swamp before her seemed more deep,
      more dark, more dreadful from uncertainty, and Jacqueline felt that
      thenceforward she could make no step in life without risk of falling into
      it. To whom now could she open her heart in confidence&mdash;that heart
      bleeding and bruised as if it had been trampled one as if some one had
      crushed it? The thing that she now knew was not like her own little
      personal secrets, such as she had imprudently confided to Fraulein Schult.
      The words that she had overheard she could repeat to no one. She must
      carry them in her heart, like the barb of an arrow in a secret wound,
      where they would fester and grow more painful day by day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, above all,&rdquo; she said at length, rising from her knees, &ldquo;let me show
      proper pride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bathed her fevered face in cold water, then she walked up to her
      mirror. As she gazed at herself with a strange interest, trying to see
      whether the entire change so suddenly accomplished in herself had left its
      visible traces on her features, she seemed to see something in her eyes
      that spoke of the clairvoyance of despair. She smiled at herself, to see
      whether the new Jacqueline could play the part, which&mdash;whether she
      would or not&mdash;was now assigned to her. What a sad smile it was!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lost everything,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have lost everything!&rdquo; And she
      remembered, as one remembers something in the far-off long ago, how that
      very morning, when she awoke, her first thought had been &ldquo;Shall I see him
      to-day?&rdquo; Each day she passed without seeing him had seemed to her a lost
      day, and she had accustomed herself to go to sleep thinking of him,
      remembering all he had said to her, and how he had looked at her. Of
      course, sometimes she had been unhappy, but what a difference it seemed
      between such vague unhappiness and what she now experienced? And then,
      when she was sad, she could always find a refuge in that dear mamma&mdash;in
      that Clotilde whom she vowed she would never kiss again, except with such
      kisses as might be necessary to avoid suspicion. Kisses of that kind were
      worth nothing. Quite the contrary! Could she kiss her father now without a
      pang? Her father! He had gone wholly over to the side of that other in
      this affair. She had seen him in one moment turn against herself. No!&mdash;no
      one was left her!... If she could only lay her head in Modeste&rsquo;s lap and
      be soothed while she crooned her old songs as in the nursery! But,
      whatever Marien or any one else might choose to say, she was no longer a
      baby. The bitter sense of her isolation arose in her. She could hardly
      breathe. Suddenly she pressed her lips upon the glass which reflected her
      own image, so sad, so pale, so desolate. She put the pity for herself into
      a long, long, fervent kiss, which seemed to say: &ldquo;Yes, I am all alone&mdash;alone
      forever.&rdquo; Then, in a spirit of revenge, she opened what seemed a
      safety-valve, preventing her from giving way to any other emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rushed for a little box which she had converted into a sort of
      reliquary. She took out of it the half-burned cigarette, the old glove,
      the withered violets, and a visiting-card with his name, on which three
      unimportant lines had been written. She insulted these keepsakes, she tore
      them with her nails, she trampled them underfoot, she reduced them to
      fragments; she left nothing whatever of them, except a pile of shreds,
      which at last she set fire to. She had a feeling as if she were employed
      in executing two great culprits, who deserved cruel tortures at her hands;
      and, with them, she slew now and forever the foolish fancy she had called
      her love. By a strange association of ideas, the famous composition, so
      praised by M. Regis, came back to her memory, and she cried:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Je ne veux me souvenir.... me souvenir de rien!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I remember, I shall be more unhappy. All has been a dream. His look
      was a dream, his pressure of my hand, his kiss on the last day, all&mdash;all&mdash;were
      dreams. He was making a fool of me when he gave me that pink which is now
      in this pile of ashes. He was laughing when he told me I was more
      beautiful than was natural. Never have I been&mdash;never shall I be in
      his eyes&mdash;more than the baby he remembers playing with her doll.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And unconsciously, as Jacqueline said these words, she imitated the
      careless accent with which she had heard them fall from the lips of the
      artist. And she would have again to meet him! If she had had thunder and
      lightning at her command, as she had had the match with which she had set
      fire to the memorials of her juvenile folly, Marien would have been
      annihilated on the spot. She was at that moment a murderess at heart. But
      the dinner-bell rang. The young fury gave a last glance at the adornments
      of her pretty bedchamber, so elegant, so original&mdash;all blue and pink,
      with a couch covered with silk embroidered with flowers. She seemed to say
      to them all: &ldquo;Keep my secret. It is a sad one. Be careful: keep it
      safely.&rdquo; The cupids on the clock, the little book-rest on a velvet stand,
      the picture of the Virgin that hung over her bed, with rosaries and palms
      entwined about it, the photographs of her girl-friends standing on her
      writing table in pretty frames of old-fashioned silk-all seemed to see her
      depart with a look of sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went down to the dining-room, resolved to prove that she would not
      submit to punishment. The best way to brave Madame de Nailles was, she
      thought, to affect great calmness and indifference, aye, even, if she
      could, some gayety. But the task before her was more difficult than she
      had expected. Apparently, as a proof of reconciliation, Marien had been
      kept to dinner. To see him so soon again after his words of outrage was
      more than she could bear. For one moment the earth seemed to sink under
      her feet; she roused her pride by an heroic effort, and that sustained
      her. She exchanged with the artist, as she always did, a friendly
      &ldquo;Good-evening!&rdquo; and ate her dinner, though it nearly choked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Nailles had red eyes; and Jacqueline made the reflection that
      women who are thirty-five should never weep. She knew that her face had
      not been made ugly by her tears, and this gave her a perverse satisfaction
      in the midst of her misery. Of Marien she thought: &ldquo;He sits there as if he
      had been put &lsquo;en penitence&rsquo;.&rdquo; No doubt he could not endure scenes, and the
      one he had just passed through must have given him the downcast look which
      Jacqueline noticed with contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      What she did not know was that his depression had more than one cause. He
      felt&mdash;and felt with shame and with discouragement&mdash;that the
      fetters of a connection which had long since ceased to charm had been
      fastened on his wrists tighter than ever; and he thought: &ldquo;I shall lose
      all my energy, I shall lose even my talent! While I wear these chains I
      shall see ever before me&mdash;ah! tortures of Tantalus!&mdash;the vision
      of a new love, fresh as the dawn which beckons to me as it passes before
      my sight, which lays on me the light touch of a caress, while I am forced
      to see it glide away, to let it vanish, disappear forever! And alas! that
      is not all. If I have deceived an inexperienced heart by words spoken or
      deeds done in a moment of weakness or temptation, can I flatter myself
      that I have acted like an honest man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is what Marien was really thinking, while Jacqueline looked at him
      with an expression she strove to make indifferent, but which he
      interpreted, though she knew it not: &ldquo;You have done me all the harm you
      can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. de Nailles meantime went on talking, with little response from his wife
      or his guest, about some vehement discussion of a new law going on just
      then in the Chamber, and he became so interested in his own discourse that
      he did not remark the constraint of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marien at last, tired of responding in monosyllables to his remarks, said
      abruptly, a short time before dessert was placed upon the table, something
      about the probability of his soon going to Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pilgrimage of art to Florence!&rdquo; cried the Baron, turning at once from
      politics. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. But wait a little&mdash;let it be after the rising
      of the Chamber. We will follow your steps. It has been the desire of my
      wife&rsquo;s life&mdash;a little jaunt to Italy. Has it not, Clotilde? So we
      will all go in September or October. What say you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In September or October, whichever suits you,&rdquo; said Marien, with despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not one month of liberty! Why couldn&rsquo;t they leave him to his Savanarola!
      Must he drag about a ball and chain like a galley-slave?
    </p>
    <p>
      Clotilde rewarded M. de Nailles with a smile&mdash;the first smile she had
      given him since their quarrel about Jacqueline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife has got over her displeasure,&rdquo; he said to himself, delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline, on her part, well remembered the day when Hubert had spoken to
      her for the first time of his intended journey, and how he had added, in a
      tone which she now knew to be badinage, but which then, alas! she had
      believed serious: &ldquo;Suppose we go together!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And her impulse to shed tears became so great, that when they left the
      dinner-table she escaped to her own room, under pretence of a headache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;you are looking wretchedly,&rdquo; said her stepmother. And, turning
      to M. de Nailles, she added: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, &lsquo;mon ami&rsquo;, she is as yellow
      as a quince!&rdquo; Marien dared not press the hand which she, who had been his
      little friend for years, offered him as usual, but this time with
      repugnance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are suffering, my poor Jacqueline!&rdquo; he ventured to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! not much,&rdquo; she answered, with a glance at once haughty and defiant,
      &ldquo;to-morrow I shall be quite well again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, saying this, she had the courage to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was not quite well the next day; and for many days after she was
      forced to stay in bed. The doctor who came to see her talked about &ldquo;low
      fever,&rdquo; attributed it to too rapid growth, and prescribed sea-bathing for
      her that summer. The fever, which was not very severe, was of great
      service to Jacqueline. It enabled her to recover in quiet from the effects
      of a bitter deception.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Nailles was not sufficiently uneasy about her to be always at
      her bedside. Usually the sick girl stayed alone, with her window-curtains
      closed, lying there in the soft half-light that was soothing to her
      nerves. The silence was broken at intervals by the voice of Modeste, who
      would come and offer her her medicine. When Jacqueline had taken it, she
      would shut her eyes, and resume, half asleep, her sad reflections. These
      were always the same. What could be the tie between her stepmother and
      Marien?
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to recall all the proofs of friendship she had seen pass between
      them, but all had taken place openly. Nothing that she could remember
      seemed suspicious. So she thought at first, but as she thought more,
      lying, feverish, upon her bed, several things, little noticed at the time,
      were recalled to her remembrance. They might mean nothing, or they might
      mean much. In the latter case, Jacqueline could not understand them very
      well. But she knew he had called her &ldquo;Clotilde,&rdquo; that he had even dared to
      say &ldquo;thou&rdquo; to her in private&mdash;these were things she knew of her own
      knowledge. Her pulse beat quicker as she thought of them; her head burned.
      In that studio, where she had passed so many happy hours, had Marien and
      her stepmother ever met as lovers?
    </p>
    <p>
      Her stepmother and Marien! She could not understand what it meant. Must
      she apply to them a dreadful word that she had picked up in the history
      books, where it had been associated with such women as Margaret of
      Burgundy, Isabeau of Bavaria, Anne Boleyn, and other princesses of very
      evil reputation? She had looked it out in the dictionary, where the
      meaning given was: &ldquo;To be unfaithful to conjugal vows.&rdquo; Even then she
      could not understand precisely the meaning of adultery, and she set
      herself to solve it during the long lonely days when she was convalescent.
      When she was able to walk from one room to another, she wandered in a
      loose dressing-gown, whose long, lank folds showed that she had grown
      taller and thinner during her illness, into the room that held the books,
      and went boldly up to the bookcase, the key of which had been left in the
      lock, for everybody had entire confidence in Jacqueline&rsquo;s scrupulous
      honesty. Never before had she broken a promise; she knew that a
      well-brought-up young girl ought to read only such books as were put into
      her hands. The idea of taking a volume from those shelves had no more
      occurred to her than the idea of taking money out of somebody&rsquo;s purse;
      that is, up to this moment it had not occurred to her to do so; but now
      that she had lost all respect for those in authority over her, Jacqueline
      considered herself released from any obligation to obey them. She
      therefore made use of the first opportunity that presented itself to take
      down a novel of George Sand, which she had heard spoken of as a very
      dangerous book, not doubting it would throw some light on the subject that
      absorbed her. But she shut up the volume in a rage when she found that it
      had nothing but excuses to offer for the fall of a married woman. After
      that, and guided only by chance, she read a number of other novels, most
      of which were of antediluvian date, thus accounting, she supposed, for
      their sentiments, which she found old fashioned. We should be wrong,
      however, if we supposed that Jacqueline&rsquo;s crude judgment of these books
      had nothing in common with true criticism. Her only object, however, in
      reading all this sentimental prose was to discover, as formerly she had
      found in poetry, something that applied to her own case; but she soon
      discovered that all the sentimental heroines in the so-called bad books
      were persons who had had bad husbands; besides, they were either widows or
      old women&mdash;at least thirty years old! It was astounding! There was
      nothing&mdash;absolutely nothing&mdash;about young girls, except instances
      in which they renounced their hopes of happiness. What an injustice! Among
      these victims the two that most attracted her sympathy were Madame de
      Camors and Renee Mauperin. But what horrors surrounded them! What a varied
      assortment of deceptions, treacheries, and mysteries, lay hidden under the
      outward decency and respectability of what men called &ldquo;the world!&rdquo; Her
      young head became a stage on which strange plays were acted. What one
      reads is good or bad for us, according to the frame of mind in which we
      read it&mdash;according as we discover in a volume healing for the
      sickness of our souls&mdash;or the contrary. In view of the circumstances
      in which she found herself, what Jacqueline absorbed from these books was
      poison.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, after the physical and moral crisis through which she had passed,
      Jacqueline resumed the life of every day, she had in her sad eyes, around
      which for some time past had been dark circles, an expression of anxiety
      such as the first contact with a knowledge of evil might have put into
      Eve&rsquo;s eyes after she had plucked the apple. Her investigations had very
      imperfectly enlightened her. She was as much perplexed as ever, with some
      false ideas besides. When she was well again, however, she continued weak
      and languid; she felt somehow as if, she had come back to her old
      surroundings from some place far away. Everything about her now seemed sad
      and unfamiliar, though outwardly nothing was altered. Her parents had
      apparently forgotten the unhappy episode of the picture. It had been sent
      away to Grandchaux, which was tantamount to its being buried. Hubert
      Marien had resumed his habits of intimacy in the family. From that time
      forth he took less and less notice of Jacqueline&mdash;whether it were
      that he owed her a grudge for all the annoyance she had been the means of
      bringing upon him, or whether he feared to burn himself in the flame which
      had once scorched him more than he admitted to himself, who can say?
      Perhaps he was only acting in obedience to orders.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. A CONVENT FLOWER
    </h2>
    <p>
      One of Jacqueline&rsquo;s first walks, after she had recovered, was to see her
      cousin Giselle at her convent. She did not seek this friend&rsquo;s society when
      she was happy and in a humor for amusement, for she thought her a little
      straightlaced, or, as she said, too like a nun; but nobody could condole
      or sympathize with a friend in trouble like Giselle. It seemed as if
      nature herself had intended her for a Sister of Charity&mdash;a Gray
      Sister, as Jacqueline would sometimes call her, making fun of her somewhat
      dull intellect, which had been benumbed, rather than stimulated, by the
      education she had received.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Benedictine Convent is situated in a dull street on the left bank of
      the Seine, all gardens and hotels&mdash;that is, detached houses. Grass
      sprouted here and there among the cobblestones. There were no street-lamps
      and no policemen. Profound silence reigned there. The petals of an acacia,
      which peeped timidly over its high wall, dropped, like flakes of snow, on
      the few pedestrians who passed by it in the springtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enormous porte-cochere gave entrance into a square courtyard, on one
      side of which was the chapel, on the other, the door that led into the
      convent. Here Jacqueline presented herself, accompanied by her old nurse,
      Modeste. She had not yet resumed her German lessons, and was striving to
      put off as long as possible any intercourse with Fraulein Schult, who had
      known of her foolish fancy, and who might perhaps renew the odious
      subject. Walking with Modeste, on the contrary, seemed like going back to
      the days of her childhood, the remembrance of which soothed her like a
      recollection of happiness and peace, now very far away; it was a
      reminiscence of the far-off limbo in which her young soul, pure and white,
      had floated, without rapture, but without any great grief or pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The porteress showed them into the parlor. There they found several pupils
      who were talking to members of their families, from whom they were
      separated by a grille, whose black bars gave to those within the
      appearance of captives, and made rather a barrier to eager demonstrations
      of affection, though they did not hinder the reception of good things to
      eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tiens! I have brought you some chocolate,&rdquo; said Jacqueline to Giselle, as
      soon as her cousin appeared, looking far prettier in her black cloth frock
      than when she wore an ordinary walking-costume. Her fair hair was drawn
      back &lsquo;a la Chinoise&rsquo; from a white forehead resembling that of a German
      Madonna; it was one of those foreheads, slightly and delicately curved,
      which phrenologists tell us indicate reflection and enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Giselle, without thanking Jacqueline for the chocolate, exclaimed at
      once: &ldquo;Mon Dieu! What has been the matter with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke rather louder than usual, it being understood that conversations
      were to be carried on in a low tone, so as not to interfere with those of
      other persons. She added: &ldquo;I find you so altered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I have been ill,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, carelessly, &ldquo;sorrow has made
      me ill,&rdquo; she added, in a whisper, looking to see whether the nun, who was
      discreetly keeping watch, walking to and fro behind the grille, might
      chance to be listening. &ldquo;Oh, ask me no questions! I must never tell you&mdash;but
      for me, you must know&mdash;the happiness of my life is at an end&mdash;is
      at an end&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt herself to be very interesting while she was speaking thus; her
      sorrows were somewhat assuaged. There was undoubtedly a certain pleasure
      in letting some one look down into the unfathomable, mysterious depths of
      a suffering soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had expected much curiosity on the part of Giselle, and had resolved
      beforehand to give her no answers; but Giselle only sighed, and said,
      softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;my poor darling! I, too, am very unhappy. If you only knew&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? Good heavens! what can have happened to you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here? oh! nothing, of course; but this year I am to leave the convent&mdash;and
      I think I can guess what will then be before me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here, seeing that the nun who was keeping guard was listening, Giselle,
      with great presence of mind, spoke louder on indifferent subjects till she
      had passed out of earshot, then she rapidly poured her secret into
      Jacqueline&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a few words that had passed between her grandmother and Madame
      d&rsquo;Argy, she had found out that Madame de Monredon intended to marry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that need not make you unhappy,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, &ldquo;unless he is
      really distasteful to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I am not sure about&mdash;perhaps he is not the one I think.
      But I hardly know why&mdash;I have a dread, a great dread, that it is one
      of our neighbors in the country. Grandmamma has several times spoken in my
      presence of the advantage of uniting our two estates&mdash;they touch each
      other&mdash;oh! I know her ideas! she wants a man well-born, one who has a
      position in the world&mdash;some one, as she says, who knows something of
      life&mdash;that is, I suppose, some one no longer young, and who has not
      much hair on his head&mdash;like Monsieur de Talbrun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he very ugly&mdash;this Monsieur de Talbrun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not ugly&mdash;and not handsome. But, just think! he is
      thirty-four!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline blushed, seeing in this speech a reflection on her own taste in
      such matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s twice my age,&rdquo; sighed Giselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course that would be dreadful if he were to stay always twice your age&mdash;for
      instance, if you were now thirty-five, he would be seventy, and a hundred
      and twenty when you reached your sixtieth year&mdash;but really to be
      twice your age now will only make him seventeen years older than
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this chatter, which was beginning to attract the notice of
      the nun, they broke off with a laugh, but it was only one of those laughs
      &lsquo;au bout des levres&rsquo;, uttered by persons who have made up their minds to
      be unhappy. Then Giselle went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about him, you understand&mdash;but he frightens me. I
      tremble to think of taking his arm, of talking to him, of being his wife.
      Just think even of saying thou to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But married people don&rsquo;t say thou to each other nowadays,&rdquo; said
      Jacqueline, &ldquo;it is considered vulgar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shall have to call him by his Christian name!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is Monsieur de Talbrun&rsquo;s Christian name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oscar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! That is not a very pretty name, but you could get over the
      difficulty&mdash;you could say &lsquo;mon ami&rsquo;. After all, your sorrows are less
      than mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Jacqueline!&rdquo; said Giselle, her soft hazel eyes moist with sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lost at one blow all my illusions, and I have made a horrible
      discovery, that it would be wicked to tell to any one&mdash;you understand&mdash;not
      even to my confessor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! but you could tell your mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget, I have no mother,&rdquo; replied Jacqueline in a tone which
      frightened her friend: &ldquo;I had a dear mamma once, but she would enter less
      than any one into my sorrows; and as to my father&mdash;it would make
      things worse to speak to him,&rdquo; she added, clasping her hands. &ldquo;Have you
      ever read any novels, Giselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; said the discreet voice of the nun, by way of warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two or three by Walter Scott.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! then you can imagine nothing like what I could tell you. How horrid
      that nun is, she stops always as she comes near us! Why can&rsquo;t she do as
      Modeste does, and leave us to talk by ourselves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed indeed as if the Argus in a black veil had overheard part of
      this conversation, not perhaps the griefs of Jacqueline, which were not
      very intelligible, but some of the words spoken by Giselle, for, drawing
      near her, she said, gently: &ldquo;We, too, shall all grieve to lose you, my
      dearest child; but remember one can serve God anywhere, and save one&rsquo;s
      soul&mdash;in the world as well as in a convent.&rdquo; And she passed on,
      giving a kind smile to Jacqueline, whom she knew, having seen her several
      times in the convent parlor, and whom she thought a nice girl,
      notwithstanding what she called her &ldquo;fly-away airs&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the airs they
      acquire from modern education,&rdquo; she said to herself, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those poor ladies would have us think of nothing but a future life,&rdquo; said
      Jacqueline, shrugging her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to think of it first of all,&rdquo; said Giselle, who had become
      serious. &ldquo;Sometimes I think my place should have been among these ladies
      who have brought me up. They are so good, and they seem to be so happy.
      Besides, do you know, I stand less in awe of them than I do of my
      grandmother. When grandmamma orders me I never shall dare to object, even
      if&mdash;But you must think me very selfish, my poor Jacqueline! I am
      talking only of myself. Do you know what you ought to do as you go away?
      You should go into the chapel, and pray with all your heart for me, that I
      may be brought in safety through my troubles about which I have told you,
      and I will do the same for yours, about which you have not told me. An
      exchange of prayers is the best foundation for a friendship,&rdquo; she added;
      for Giselle had many little convent maxims at her fingers&rsquo; ends, to which,
      when she uttered them, her sincerity of look and tone gave a personal
      meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, much moved. &ldquo;It has done me good to see
      you. Take this chocolate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you must take this,&rdquo; said Giselle, giving her a little illuminated
      card, with sacred words and symbols.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu, dearest-say, have you ever detested any one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; cried Giselle, with horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I do detest&mdash;detest&mdash;You are right, I will go into the
      chapel. I need some exorcism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And laughing at her use of this last word&mdash;the same little mirthless
      laugh that she had uttered before&mdash;Jacqueline went away, followed by
      the admiring glances of the other girls, who from behind the bars of their
      cage noted the brilliant plumage of this bird who was at liberty. She
      crossed the courtyard, and, followed by Modeste, entered the chapel, where
      she sank upon her knees. The mystic half-light of the place, tinged purple
      by its passage through the stained windows, seemed to enlarge the little
      chancel, parted in two by a double grille, behind which the nuns could
      hear the service without being seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence was so deep that the low murmur of a prayer could now and then
      be heard. The worshipers might have fancied themselves a hundred leagues
      from all the noises of the world, which seemed to die out when they
      reached the convent walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline read, and re-read mechanically, the words printed in letters of
      gold on the little card Giselle had given her. It was a symbolical
      picture, and very ugly; but the words were: &ldquo;Oh! that I had wings like a
      dove, for then would I flee away and be at rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wings!&rdquo; she repeated, with vague aspiration. The aspiration seemed to
      disengage her from herself, and from this earth, which had nothing more to
      offer her. Ah! how far away was now the time when she had entered
      churches, full of happiness and hope, to offer a candle that her prayer
      might be granted, which she felt sure it would be! All was vanity! As she
      gazed at the grille, behind which so many women, whose worldly lives had
      been cut short, now lived, safe from the sorrows and temptations of this
      world, Jacqueline seemed for the first time to understand why Giselle
      regretted that she might not share forever the blessed peace enjoyed in
      the convent. A torpor stole over her, caused by the dimness, the faint
      odor of the incense, and the solemn silence. She imagined herself in the
      act of giving up the world. She saw herself in a veil, with her eyes
      raised to Heaven, very pale, standing behind the grille. She would have to
      cut off her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      That seemed hard, but she would make the sacrifice. She would accept
      anything, provided the ungrateful pair, whom she would not name, could
      feel sorrow for her loss&mdash;maybe even remorse. Full of these ideas,
      which certainly had little in common with the feelings of those who seek
      to forgive those who trespass against them, Jacqueline continued to
      imagine herself a Benedictine sister, under the soothing influence of her
      surroundings, just as she had mistaken the effects of physical weakness
      when she was ill for a desire to die. Such feelings were the result of a
      void which the whole universe, as she thought, never could fill, but it
      was really a temporary vacuum, like that caused by the loss of a first
      tooth. These teeth come out with the first jar, and nature intends them to
      be speedily replaced by others, much more permanent; but children cry when
      they are pulled out, and fancy they are in very tight. Perhaps they
      suffer, after all, nearly as much as they think they do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle!&rdquo; said Modeste, touching her on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was content to be here,&rdquo; answered Jacqueline, with a sigh. &ldquo;Do you
      know, Modeste,&rdquo; she went on, when they got out of doors, &ldquo;that I have
      almost made up my mind to be a nun. What do you say to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid!&rdquo; cried the old nurse, much startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life is so hard,&rdquo; replied her young mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for you, anyhow. It would be a sin to say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Modeste, we so little know the real truth of things&mdash;we can see
      only appearances. Don&rsquo;t you think that a linen band over my forehead would
      be very becoming to me? I should look like Saint Theresa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what would be the good of your looking like Saint Theresa, when there
      would be nobody to tell you so?&rdquo; said Modeste, with the practical
      good-sense that never forsook her. &ldquo;You would be beautiful for yourself
      alone. You would not even be allowed a looking-glass just talk about that
      fancy to Monsieur&mdash;we should soon see what he would say to such a
      notion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. de Nailles, having just left the Chamber, was crossing the Pont de la
      Concorde on foot at this moment. His daughter ran up to him, and caught
      him by the arm. They walked homeward talking of very different things from
      bolts and bars. The Baron, who was a weak man, thought in his heart that
      he had been too severe with his daughter for some time past. As he
      recalled what had taken place, the anger of Madame de Nailles in the
      matter of the picture seemed to him to have been extreme and unnecessary.
      Jacqueline was just at an age when young girls are apt to be nervous and
      impressionable; they had been wrong to be rough with one who was so
      sensitive. His wife was quite of his opinion, she acknowledged (not
      wishing him to think too much on the subject) that she had been too
      quick-tempered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she had said, frankly, &ldquo;I am jealous; I want things to myself. I
      own I was angry when I thought that Jacqueline was about to throw off my
      authority, and hurt when I found she was capable of keeping up a
      concealment&mdash;when I believed she was so open always with me. My
      behavior was foolish, I acknowledge. But what can we do? Neither of us can
      go and ask her pardon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;all we can do is to treat her with a
      little more consideration for the future; and, with your permission, I
      shall use her illness as an excuse for spoiling her a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have carte blanche, my dear, I agree to everything.&rdquo; So M. de
      Nailles, with his daughter&rsquo;s arm in his, began to spoil her, as he had
      intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are still rather pale,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but sea-bathing will change all
      that. Would you like to go to the seaside next month?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline answered with a little incredulous smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem very sure about it. In the first place, where shall we go?
      Your mamma seems to fancy Houlgate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we must do what she wishes,&rdquo; replied Jacqueline, rather
      bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, little daughter, what would you like? What do you say to Treport?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like Treport very much, because there we should be near Madame
      d&rsquo;Argy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline had felt much drawn to Madame d&rsquo;Argy since her troubles, for
      she had been the nearest friend of her own mother&mdash;her own dead
      mother, too long forgotten. The chateau of Madame d&rsquo;Argy, called
      Lizerolles, was only two miles from Treport, in a charming situation on
      the road to St. Valery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very thing, then!&rdquo; said M. de Nailles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fred is going to spend a month at Lizerolles with his mother. You might
      ride on horseback with him. He is going to enjoy a holiday, poor fellow!
      before he has to be sent off on long and distant voyages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to ride,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, still in the tone of a
      victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor thinks riding would be good for you, and you have time enough
      yet to take some lessons. Mademoiselle Schult could take you nine or ten
      times to the riding-school. And I will go with you the first time,&rdquo; added
      M. de Nailles, in despair at not having been able to please her. &ldquo;To-day
      we will go to Blackfern&rsquo;s and order a habit&mdash;a riding-habit! Can I do
      more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this, as if by magic, whether she would or not, the lines of sadness
      and sullenness disappeared from Jacqueline&rsquo;s face; her eyes sparkled. She
      gave one more proof, that to every Parisienne worthy of the name, the two
      pleasures in riding are, first to have a perfectly fitting habit,
      secondly, to have the opportunity of showing how pretty she can be after a
      new fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go to Blackfern&rsquo;s now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This very moment, if you wish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really mean Blackfern? Yvonne&rsquo;s habit came from Blackfern&rsquo;s!&rdquo; Yvonne
      d&rsquo;Etaples was the incarnation of chic&mdash;of fashionable elegance&mdash;in
      Jacqueline&rsquo;s eyes. Her heart beat with pleasure when she thought how Belle
      and Dolly would envy her when she told them: &ldquo;I have a myrtle-green
      riding-habit, just like Yvonne&rsquo;s.&rdquo; She danced rather than walked as they
      went together to Blackfern&rsquo;s. A habit was much nicer than a long gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour later they were in the waiting-room, where the last
      creations of the great ladies&rsquo; tailor, were displayed upon lay figures,
      among saleswomen and &lsquo;essayeuses&rsquo;, the very prettiest that could be found
      in England or the Batignolles, chosen because they showed off to
      perfection anything that could be put upon their shoulders, from the
      ugliest to the most extravagant. Deceived by the unusual elegance of these
      beautiful figures, ladies who are neither young nor well-shaped allow
      themselves to be beguiled and cajoled into buying things not suited to
      them. Very seldom does a hunchbacked dowager hesitate to put upon her
      shoulders the garment that draped so charmingly those of the living statue
      hired to parade before her. Jacqueline could not help laughing as she
      watched this way of hunting larks; and thought the mirror might have
      warned them, like a scarecrow, rather than have tempted them into the
      snare.
    </p>
    <p>
      The head tailor of the establishment made them wait long enough to allow
      the pretty showgirls to accomplish their work of temptation. They
      fascinated Jacqueline&rsquo;s father by their graces and their glances, while at
      the same time they warbled into his daughter&rsquo;s ear, with a slightly
      foreign&rsquo; accent: &ldquo;That would be so becoming to Mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For ladies going to the seaside there were things of the most exquisite
      simplicity: this white fur, trimmed with white velvet, for instance; that
      jacket like the uniform of a naval officer with a cap to match&mdash;&ldquo;All
      to please Fred,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, laughing. M. de Nailles, while they
      waited for the tailor, chose two costumes quite as original as those of
      Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Etaples, which delighted Jacqueline all the more, because
      she thought it probable they would displease her stepmother. At last the
      magnificent personage, his face adorned with luxuriant whiskers, appeared
      with the bow of a great artist or a diplomatist; took Jacqueline&rsquo;s measure
      as if he were fulfilling some important function, said a few brief words
      to his secretary, and then disappeared; the group of English beauties
      saying in chorus that Mademoiselle might come back that day week and try
      it on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, a week later Jacqueline, seated on the wooden-horse used for
      this purpose, had the satisfaction of assuring herself that her habit,
      fitting marvelously to her bust, showed not a wrinkle, any more than a
      &lsquo;gant de Suede&rsquo; shows on the hand; it was closely fitted to a figure not
      yet fully developed, but which the creator of the chef-d&rsquo;oeuvre deigned to
      declare was faultless. Usually, he said, he recommended his customers to
      wear a certain corset of a special cut, with elastic material over the
      hips covered by satin that matched the riding-habit, but at Mademoiselle&rsquo;s
      age, and so supple as she was, the corset was not necessary. In short, the
      habit was fashioned to perfection, and fitted like her skin to her little
      flexible figure. In her close-fitting petticoat, her riding-trousers and
      nothing else, Jacqueline felt herself half naked, though she was buttoned
      up to her throat. She had taken an attitude on her wooden horse such as
      might have been envied by an accomplished equestrienne, her elbows held
      well back, her shoulders down, her chest expanded, her right leg over the
      pommel, her left foot in the stirrup, and never after did any real gallop
      give her the same delight as this imaginary ride on an imaginary horse,
      she looking at herself with entire satisfaction all the time in an
      enormous cheval-glass.

      CHAPTER VII. THE BLUE BAND
    </h2>
    <p>
      Love, like any other human malady, should be treated according to the age
      and temperament of the sufferer. Madame de Nailles, who was a very keen
      observer, especially where her own interests were concerned, lent herself
      with the best possible grace to everything that might amuse and distract
      Jacqueline, of whom she had by this time grown afraid. Not that she now
      dreaded her as a rival. The attitude of coldness and reserve that the
      young girl had adopted in her intercourse with Marien, her stepmother
      could see, was no evidence of coquetry. She showed, in her behavior to the
      friend of the family, a freedom from embarrassment which was new to her,
      and a frigidity which could not possibly have been assumed so
      persistently. No! what struck Madame de Nailles was the suddenness of this
      transformation. Jacqueline evidently took no further interest in Marien;
      she had apparently no longer any affection for herself&mdash;she, who had
      been once her dear little mamma, whom she had loved so tenderly, now felt
      herself to be considered only as a stepmother. Fraulein Schult, too,
      received no more confidences. What did it all mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Jacqueline, through any means, discovered a secret, which, in her
      hands, might be turned into a most dangerous weapon? She had a way of
      saying before the guilty pair: &ldquo;Poor papa!&rdquo; with an air of pity, as she
      kissed him, which made Madame de Nailles&rsquo;s flesh creep, and sometimes she
      would amuse herself by making ambiguous remarks which shot arrows of
      suspicion into a heart already afraid. &ldquo;I feel sure,&rdquo; thought the
      Baroness, &ldquo;that she has found out everything. But, no! it seems
      impossible. How can I discover what she knows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline&rsquo;s revenge consisted in leaving her stepmother in doubt. She
      more than suspected, not without cause, that Fraulein Schult was false to
      her, and had the wit to baffle all the clever questions of her
      &lsquo;promeneuse&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My worship of a man of genius&mdash;a great artist? Oh! that has all come
      to an end since I have found out that his devotion belongs to an elderly
      lady with a fair complexion and light hair. I am only sorry for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline had great hopes that these cruel words would be reported&mdash;as
      they were&mdash;to her stepmother, and, of course, they did not mitigate
      the Baroness&rsquo;s uneasiness. Madame de Nailles revenged herself for this
      insult by dismissing the innocent echo of the impertinence&mdash;of
      course, under some plausible pretext. She felt it necessary also to be
      very cautious how she treated the enemy whom she was forced to shelter
      under her own roof. Her policy&mdash;a policy imposed on her by force of
      circumstances&mdash;was one of great indulgence and consideration, so that
      Jacqueline, soon feeling that she was for the present under no control,
      took the bit between her teeth. No other impression can adequately convey
      an idea of the sort of fury with which she plunged into pleasure and
      excitement, a state of mind which apparently, without any transition,
      succeeded her late melancholy. She had done with sentiment, she thought,
      forever. She meant to be practical and positive, a little Parisienne, and
      &ldquo;in the swim.&rdquo; There were plenty of examples among those she knew that she
      could follow. Berthe, Helene, and Claire Wermant were excellent leaders in
      that sort of thing. Those three daughters of the &lsquo;agent de change&rsquo; were at
      this time at Treport, in charge of a governess, who let them do whatever
      they pleased, subject only to be scolded by their father, who came down
      every Saturday to Treport, on that train that was called the &lsquo;train des
      maris&rsquo;. They had made friends with two or three American girls, who were
      called &ldquo;fast,&rdquo; and Jacqueline was soon enrolled in the ranks of that gay
      company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cure that was begun on the wooden horse at Blackfern&rsquo;s was completed
      on the sea-shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls with whom she now associated were nine or ten little imps of
      Satan, who, with their hair flying in the wind and their caps over one
      ear, made the quiet beach ring with their boy-like gayety. They were
      called &ldquo;the Blue Band,&rdquo; because of a sort of uniform that they adopted. We
      speak of them intentionally as masculine, and not feminine, because what
      is masculine best suited their appearance and behavior, for, though all
      could flirt like coquettes of experience, they were more like boys than
      girls, if judged by their age and their costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      These Blues lived close to one another on that avenue that is edged with
      chalets, cottages, and villas, whose lower floors are abundantly provided
      with great glass windows, which seem to let the ocean into their very
      rooms, as well as to lay bare everything that passes in them to the public
      eye, as frankly as if their inmates bivouacked in the open street. Nothing
      was private; neither the meals, nor the coming and going of visitors. It
      must be said, however, that the inhabitants of these glass houses were
      very seldom at home. Bathing, and croquet, or tennis, at low water, on the
      sands, searching for shells, fishing with nets, dances at the Casino,
      little family dances alternating with concerts, to which even children
      went till nine o&rsquo;clock, would seem enough to fill up the days of these
      young people, but they had also to make boating excursions to Cayeux,
      Crotoy, and Hourdel, besides riding parties in the beautiful country that
      surrounded the Chateau of Lizerolles, where they usually dismounted on
      their return.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Lizerolles they were received by Madame d&rsquo;Argy, who was delighted that
      they provided safe amusement for her son, who appeared in the midst of
      this group of half-grown girls like a young cock among the hens of his
      harem. Frederic d&rsquo;Argy, the young naval officer, who was enjoying his
      holiday, as M. de Nailles had said, was enjoying it exceedingly. How
      often, long after, on board the ship Floye, as he paced the silent
      quarter-deck, far from any opportunity of flirting, did he recall the
      forms and faces of these young girls, some dark, some fair, some
      rosy-half-women and half-children, who made much of him, and scolded him,
      and teased him, and contended for his attentions, while no better could be
      had, on purpose to tease one another. Oh! what a delightful time he had
      had! They did not leave him to himself one moment. He had to lift them
      into their saddles, to assist them as they clambered over the rocks, to
      superintend their attempts at swimming, to dance with them all by turns,
      and to look after them in the difficult character of Mentor, for he was
      older than they, and were they not entrusted to his care? What a serious
      responsibility! Had not Mentor even found himself too often timid and
      excited when one little firm foot was placed in his hand, when his arm was
      round one little waist, when he could render her as a cavalier a thousand
      little services, or accept with gladness the role of her consoler. He did
      everything he could think of to please them, finding all of them charming,
      though Jacqueline never ceased to be the one he preferred, a preference
      which she might easily have inferred from the poor lad&rsquo;s unusual timidity
      and awkwardness when he was brought into contact with her. But she paid no
      attention to his devotion, accepting himself and all he did for her as, in
      some sort, her personal property.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was of no consequence, he did not count; what was he but her comrade
      and former playfellow?
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily for Fred, he took pleasure in the familiarity with which she
      treated him&mdash;a familiarity which, had he known it, was not
      flattering. He was in the seventh heaven for a whole fortnight, during
      which he was the recipient of more dried flowers and bows of ribbon than
      he ever got in all the rest of his life&mdash;the American girls were very
      fond of giving keepsakes&mdash;but then his star waned. He was no longer
      the only one. The grown-up brother of the Wermants came to Treport&mdash;Raoul,
      with his air of a young man about town&mdash;a boulevardier, with his
      jacket cut in the latest fashion, with his cockle-shell of a boat, which
      he managed as well on salt water as on fresh, sculling with his arms bare,
      a cigarette in his mouth, a monocle in his eye, and a pith-helmet, such as
      is worn in India. The young ladies used to gather on the sands to watch
      him as he struck the water with the broad blade of his scull, near enough
      for them to see and to admire his nautical ability. They thought all his
      jokes amusing, and they delighted in his way of seizing his partner for a
      waltz and bearing her off as if she were a prize, hardly allowing her to
      touch the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred thought him, with his stock of old jokes, very ill-mannered. He
      laughed at his sculling, and had a great mind to strike him after he saw
      him waltzing with Jacqueline. But he had to acknowledge the general
      appreciation felt for the fellow whom he called vulgar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul Wermant did not stay long at Treport. He had only come to see his
      sisters on his way to Dieppe, where he expected to meet a certain Leah
      Skip, an actress from the &lsquo;Nouveautes&rsquo;. If he kept her waiting, however,
      for some days, it was because he was loath to leave the handsome Madame de
      Villegry, who was living near her friend Madame de Nailles, recruiting
      herself after the fatigues of the winter season. Such being the situation,
      the young girls of the Blue Band might have tried in vain to make any
      impression upon him. But the hatred with which he inspired Fred found some
      relief in the composition of fragments of melancholy verse, which the
      young midshipman hid under his mattresses. It is not an uncommon thing for
      naval men to combine a love of the sea with a love of poetry. Fred&rsquo;s
      verses were not good, but they were full of dejection. The poor fellow
      compared Raoul Wermant to Faust, and himself to Siebel. He spoke of
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        The youth whose eyes were brimming with salt tears,
        Whose heart was troubled by a thousand fears,
        Poor slighted lover!-since in his heavy heart
        All his illusions perish and depart.
</pre>
    <p>
      Again, he wrote of Siebel:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        O Siebel!&mdash;thine is but the common fate!
        They told thee Fortune upon youth would wait;
        &lsquo;Tis false when love&rsquo;s in question-and you may&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      Here he enumerated all the proofs of tenderness possible for a woman to
      give her lover, and then he added:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        You may know all, poor Siebel!&mdash;all, some day,
        When weary of this life and all its dreams,
        You learn to know it is not what it seems;
        When there is nothing that can cheer you more,
        All that remains is fondly to adore!
</pre>
    <p>
      And after trying in vain to find a rhyme for lover, he cried:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        Oh! tell me&mdash;if one grief exceeds another
        Is not this worst, to feel mere friendship moves
        To cruel kindness the dear girl he loves?
</pre>
    <p>
      Fred&rsquo;s mother surprised him one night while he was watering with his tears
      the ink he was putting to so sorry a use. She had been aware that he sat
      up late at night&mdash;his sleeplessness was not the insomnia of genius&mdash;for
      she had seen the glare of light from his little lamp burning later than
      the usual bedtime of the chateau, in one of the turret chambers at
      Lizerolles.
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain Fred denied that he was doing anything, in vain he tried to put
      his papers out of sight; his mother was so persuasive that at last he
      owned everything to her, and in addition to the comfort he derived from
      his confession, he gained a certain satisfaction to his &lsquo;amour-propre&rsquo;,
      for Madame d&rsquo;Argy thought the verses beautiful. A mother&rsquo;s geese are
      always swans. But it was only when she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you should
      not marry your Jacqueline&mdash;such a thing is not by any means
      impossible,&rdquo; and promised to do all in her power to insure his happiness,
      that Fred felt how dearly he loved his mother. Oh, a thousand times more
      than he had ever supposed he loved her! However, he had not yet done with
      the agonies that lie in wait for lovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Monredon arrived one day at the Hotel de la Plage, accompanied
      by her granddaughter, whom she had taken away from the convent before the
      beginning of the holidays. Since she had fully arranged the marriage with
      M. de Talbrun, it seemed important that Giselle should acquire some
      liveliness, and recruit her health, before the fatal wedding-day arrived.
      M. de Talbrun liked ladies to be always well and always lively, and it was
      her duty to see that Giselle accommodated herself to his taste;
      sea-bathing, life in the open air, and merry companions, were the things
      she needed to make her a little less thin, to give her tone, and to take
      some of her convent stiffness out of her. Besides, she could have free
      intercourse with her intended husband, thanks to the greater freedom of
      manners permitted at the sea-side. Such were the ideas of Madame de
      Monredon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Giselle! In vain they dressed her in fine clothes, in vain they
      talked to her and scolded her from morning till night, she continued to be
      the little convent-bred schoolgirl she had always been; with downcast
      eyes, pale as a flower that has known no sunlight, and timid to a point of
      suffering. M. de Talbrun frightened her as much as ever, and she had
      looked forward to the comfort of weeping in the arms of Jacqueline, who,
      the last time she had seen her, had been herself so unhappy. But what was
      her astonishment to find the young girl, who, a few weeks before, had made
      her such tragic confidences through the grille in the convent parlor,
      transformed into a creature bent on excitement and amusement. When she
      attempted to allude to the subject on which Jacqueline had spoken to her
      at the convent, and to ask her what it was that had then made her so
      unhappy, Jacqueline cried: &ldquo;Oh! my dear, I have forgotten all about it!&rdquo;
       But there was exaggeration in this profession of forgetfulness, and she
      hurriedly drew Giselle back to the game of croquet, where they were joined
      by M. de Talbrun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The future husband of Giselle was a stout young fellow, short and
      thick-set, with broad shoulders, a large flat face, and strong jaws,
      ornamented with an enormous pair of whiskers, which partly compensated him
      for a loss of hair. He had never done anything but shoot and hunt over his
      property nine months in the year, and spend the other three months in
      Paris, where the jockey Club and ballet-dancers sufficed for his
      amusement. He did not pretend to be a man whose bachelor life had been
      altogether blameless, but he considered himself to be a &ldquo;correct&rdquo; man,
      according to what he understood by that expression, which implied neither
      talents, virtues, nor good manners; nevertheless, all the Blue Band agreed
      that he was a finished type of gentleman-hood. Even Raoul&rsquo;s sisters had to
      confess, with a certain disgust, that, whatever people may say, in our own
      day the aristocracy of wealth has to lower its flag before the authentic
      quarterings of the old noblesse. They secretly envied Giselle because she
      was going to be a grande dame, while all the while they asserted that
      old-fashioned distinctions had no longer any meaning. Nevertheless, they
      looked forward to the day when they, too, might take their places in the
      Faubourg St. Germain. One may purchase that luxury with a fortune of eight
      hundred thousand francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The croquet-ground, which was underwater at high tide, was a long stretch
      of sand that fringed the shingle. Two parties were formed, in which care
      was taken to make both sides as nearly equal as possible, after which the
      game began, with screams, with laughter, a little cheating and some
      disputes, as is the usual custom. All this appeared to amuse Oscar de
      Talbrun&mdash;exceedingly. For the first time during his wooing he was not
      bored. The Misses Sparks&mdash;Kate and Nora&mdash;by their &ldquo;high spirits&rdquo;
       agreeably reminded him of one or two excursions he had made in past days
      into Bohemian society.
    </p>
    <p>
      He formed the highest opinion of Jacqueline when he saw how her still
      short skirts showed pretty striped silk stockings, and how her well-shaped
      foot was planted firmly on a blue ball, when she was preparing to roquer
      the red one. The way in which he fixed his eyes upon her gave great
      offense to Fred, and did it not alarm and shock Giselle? No! Giselle
      looked on calmly at the fun and talk around her, as unmoved as the stump
      of a tree, spoiling the game sometimes by her ignorance or her
      awkwardness, well satisfied that M. de Talbrun should leave her alone.
      Talking with him was very distasteful to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been more stupid than usual,&rdquo; had been what her grandmother had
      never failed to say to her in Paris after one of his visits, which he
      alternated with bouquets. But at Treport no one seemed to mind her being
      stupid, and indeed M. de Talbrun hardly thought of her existence, up to
      the moment when they were all nearly caught by the first wave that came
      rolling in over the croquet-ground, when all the girls took flight,
      flushed, animated, and with lively gesticulation, while the gentlemen
      followed with the box into which had been hastily flung hoops, balls, and
      mallets.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their way Count Oscar condescendingly explained to Fred, as to a
      novice, that the only good thing about croquet was that it brought men and
      girls together. He was himself very good at games, he said, having
      remarkably firm muscles and exceptionally sharp sight; but he went on to
      add that he had not been able to show what he could do that day. The wet
      sand did not make so good a croquet-ground as the one he had had made in
      his park! It is a good thing to know one&rsquo;s ground in all circumstances,
      but especially in playing croquet. Then, dexterously passing from the game
      to the players, he went on to say, under cover of giving Fred a warning,
      that a man need not fear going too far with those girls from America&mdash;they
      had known how to flirt from the time they were born. They could look out
      for themselves, they had talons and beaks; but up to a certain point they
      were very easy to get on with. Those other players were queer little
      things; the three sisters Wermant were not wanting in chic, but, hang it!&mdash;the
      sweetest flower of them all, to his mind, was the tall one, the dark one&mdash;unripe
      fruit in perfection! &ldquo;And a year or two hence,&rdquo; added M. de Talbrun, with
      all the self-confidence of an expert, &ldquo;every one will be talking about her
      in the world of society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Fred kept silent, trying to curb his wrath. But the blood mounted to
      his temples as he listened to these remarks, poured into his ear by a man
      of thirty-five, between puffs of his cigar, because there was nobody else
      to whom he could make them. But they seemed to Fred very ill-mannered and
      ill-timed. If he had not dreaded making himself absurd, he would gladly
      have stood forth as the champion of the Sparks, the Wermants, and all the
      other members of the Blue Band, so that he might give vent to the anger
      raging in his heart on hearing that odious compliment to Jacqueline. Why
      was he not old enough to marry her? What right had that detestable Talbrun
      to take notice of any girl but his fiancee? If he himself could marry now,
      his choice would soon be made! No doubt, later&mdash;as his mother had
      said to him. But would Jacqueline wait? Everybody was beginning to admire
      her. Somebody would carry her off&mdash;somebody would cut him out while
      he was away at sea. Oh, horrible thought for a young lover!
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, at the Casino, while dancing a quadrille with Giselle, he
      could not refrain from saying to her, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you object to Monsieur de
      Talbrun&rsquo;s dancing so much with Jacqueline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&mdash;I?&rdquo; she cried, astonished, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why he should not.&rdquo;
       And then, with a faint laugh, she added: &ldquo;Oh, if she would only take him&mdash;and
      keep him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Madame de Monredon kept a sharp eye upon M. de Talbrun. &ldquo;It seems to
      me,&rdquo; she said, looking fixedly into the face of her future
      grandson-in-law, &ldquo;that you really take pleasure in making children skip
      about with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I do,&rdquo; he replied, frankly and good-humoredly. &ldquo;It makes me feel young
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Madame de Monredon was satisfied. She was ready to admit that most men
      marry women who have not particularly enchanted them, and she had brought
      up Giselle with all those passive qualities, which, together with a large
      fortune, usually suit best with a &lsquo;mariage de convenance&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Jacqueline piqued herself upon her worldly wisdom, which she
      looked upon as equal to Madame de Monredon&rsquo;s, since the terrible event
      which had filled her mind with doubts. She thought M. de Talbrun would do
      well enough for a husband, and she took care to say so to Giselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a fact,&rdquo; she told her, with all the self-confidence of large
      experience, &ldquo;that men who are very fascinating always remain bachelors.
      That is probably why Monsieur de Cymier, Madame de Villegry&rsquo;s handsome
      cousin, does not think of marrying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was mistaken. The Comte de Cymier, a satellite who revolved around
      that star of beauty, Madame de Villegry, had been by degrees brought round
      by that lady herself to thoughts of matrimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Villegry, notwithstanding her profuse use of henna and many
      cosmetics, which was always the first thing to strike those who saw her,
      prided herself on being uncompromised as to her moral character. There are
      some women who, because they stop short of actual vice, consider
      themselves irreproachable. They are willing, so to speak, to hang out the
      bush, but keep no tavern. In former times an appearance of evil was
      avoided in order to cover evil deeds, but at present there are those who,
      under the cover of being only &ldquo;fast,&rdquo; risk the appearance of evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Villegry was what is sometimes called a &ldquo;professional beauty.&rdquo;
       She devoted many hours daily to her toilette, she liked to have a crowd of
      admirers around her. But when one of them became too troublesome, she got
      rid of him by persuading him to marry. She had before this proposed
      several young girls to Gerard de Cymier, each one plainer and more
      insignificant than the others. It was to tell his dear friend that the one
      she had last suggested was positively too ugly for him, that the young
      attache to an embassy had come down to the sea-side to visit her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after his arrival he was sitting on the shingle at Madame de
      Villegry&rsquo;s feet, both much amused by the grotesque spectacle presented by
      the bathers, who exhibited themselves in all degrees of ugliness and
      deformity. Of course Madame de Villegry did not bathe, being, as she said,
      too nervous. She was sitting under a large parasol and enjoying her own
      superiority over those wretched, amphibious creatures who waddled on the
      sands before her, comparing Madame X to a seal and Mademoiselle Z to the
      skeleton of a cuttle-fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! it was that kind of thing you wished me to marry,&rdquo; said M. de
      Cymier, in a tone of resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my poor friend, what would you have? All young girls are like that.
      They improve when they are married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If one could only be sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One is never sure of anything, especially anything relating to young
      girls. One can not say that they do more than exist till they are married.
      A husband has to make whatever he chooses out of them. You are quite
      capable of making what you choose of your wife. Take the risk, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could educate her as to morals&mdash;though, I must say, I am not much
      used to that kind of instruction; but you will permit me to think that, as
      to person, I should at least wish to see a rough sketch of what I may
      expect in my wife before my marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, a girl who had been bathing came out of the water a few
      yards from them; the elegant outline of her slender figure, clad in a
      bathing-suit of white flannel, which clung to her closely, was thrown into
      strong relief by the clear blue background of a summer sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tiens!&mdash;but she is pretty!&rdquo; cried Gerard, breaking off what he was
      saying: &ldquo;And she is the first pretty one I have seen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Villegry took up her tortoiseshell opera-glasses, which were
      fastened to her waist, but already the young girl, over whose shoulders an
      attentive servant had flung a wrapper&mdash;a &lsquo;peignoir-eponge&rsquo;&mdash;had
      run along the boardwalk and stopped before her, with a gay &ldquo;Good-morning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacqueline!&rdquo; said Madame de Villegry. &ldquo;Well, my dear child, did you find
      the water pleasant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delightful!&rdquo; said the young girl, giving a rapid glance at M. de Cymier,
      who had risen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking at her with evident admiration, an admiration at which she
      felt much flattered. She was closely wrapped in her soft, snow-white
      peignoir, bordered with red, above which rose her lovely neck and head.
      She was trying to catch, on the point of one little foot, one of her
      bathing shoes, which had slipped from her. The foot which, when well shod,
      M. de Talbrun, through his eyeglass, had so much admired, was still
      prettier without shoe or stocking. It was so perfectly formed, so white,
      with a little pink tinge here and there, and it was set upon so delicate
      an ankle! M. de Cymier looked first at the foot, and then his glance
      passed upward over all the rest of the young figure, which could be seen
      clearly under the clinging folds of the wet drapery. Her form could be
      discerned from head to foot, though nothing was uncovered but the pretty
      little arm which held together with a careless grace the folds of her
      raiment. The eye of the experienced observer ran rapidly over the outline
      of her figure, till it reached the dark head and the brown hair, which
      rippled in little curls over her forehead. Her complexion, slightly
      golden, was not protected by one of those absurd hats which many bathers
      place on top of oiled silk caps which fit them closely. Neither was the
      precaution of oiled silk wanted to protect the thick and curling hair, now
      sprinkled with great drops that shone like pearls and diamonds. The water,
      instead of plastering her hair upon her temples, had made it more curly
      and more fleecy, as it hung over her dark eyebrows, which, very near
      together at the nose, gave to her eyes a peculiar, slightly oblique
      expression. Her teeth were dazzling, and were displayed by the smile which
      parted her lips&mdash;lips which were, if anything, too red for her pale
      complexion. She closed her eyelids now and then to shade her eyes from the
      too blinding sunlight. Those eyes were not black, but that hazel which has
      golden streaks. Though only half open, they had quickly taken in the fact
      that the young man sitting beside Madame de Villegry was very handsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she went on with a swift step to her bathing-house, she drew out two
      long pins from her back hair, shaking it and letting it fall down her back
      with a slightly impatient and imperious gesture; she wished, probably,
      that it might dry more quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; said M. de Cymier, watching her till she disappeared into the
      bathing-house. &ldquo;I never should have thought that it was all her own! There
      is nothing wanting in her. That is a young creature it is pleasant to
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Madame de Villegry, quietly, &ldquo;she will be very good-looking
      when she is eighteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she nearly eighteen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is and she is not, for time passes so quickly. A girl goes to sleep a
      child, and wakes up old enough to be married. Would you like to be
      informed, without loss of time, as to her fortune?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I should not care much about her dot. I look out first for other
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, of course; but Jacqueline de Nailles comes of a very good
      family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she the daughter of the deputy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, his only daughter. He has a pretty house in the Parc Monceau and a
      chateau of some importance in the Haute-Vienne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; but, I repeat, I am not mercenary. Of course, if I should
      marry, I should like, for my wife&rsquo;s sake, to live as well as a married man
      as I have lived as a bachelor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which means that you would be satisfied with a fortune equal to your own.
      I should have thought you might have asked more. It is true that if you
      have been suddenly thunderstruck that may alter your calculations&mdash;for
      it was very sudden, was it not? Venus rising from the sea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t exaggerate! But you are not so cruel, seeing you are always
      urging me to marry, as to wish me to take a wife who looks like a fright
      or a horror.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven preserve me from any such wish! I should be very glad if my little
      friend Jacqueline were destined to work your reformation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I defy the most careful parent to find anything against me at this
      moment, unless it be a platonic devotion. The youth of Mademoiselle de
      Nailles is an advantage, for I might indulge myself in that till we were
      married, and then I should settle down and leave Paris, where nothing
      keeps me but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a foolish fancy,&rdquo; laughed Madame de Villegry. &ldquo;However, in return for
      your madrigal, accept the advice of a friend. The Nailles seem to me to be
      prosperous, but everybody in society appears so, and one never knows what
      may happen any day. You would not do amiss if, before you go on, you were
      to talk with Wermant, the &lsquo;agent de change&rsquo;, who has a considerable
      knowledge of the business affairs of Jacqueline&rsquo;s father. He could tell
      you about them better than I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wermant is at Treport, is he not? I thought I saw him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is here till Monday. You have twenty-four hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really think I am in such a hurry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take a bet that by this time to-morrow you will not know exactly
      the amount of her dot and the extent of her expectations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would lose. I have something else to think of&mdash;now and always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; she said, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have forbidden me ever to mention it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence ensued. Then Madame de Villegry said, smiling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you would like me to present you this evening to my friends the
      De Nailles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in fact they all met that evening at the Casino, and Jacqueline, in a
      gown of scarlet foulard, which would have been too trying for any other
      girl, seemed to M. de Cymier as pretty as she had been in her
      bathing-costume. Her hair was not dressed high, but it was gathered
      loosely together and confined by a ribbon of the same color as her gown,
      and she wore a little sailor hat besides. In this costume she had been
      called by M. de Talbrun the &ldquo;Fra Diavolo of the Seas,&rdquo; and she never
      better supported that part, by liveliness and audacity, than she did that
      evening, when she made a conquest that was envied&mdash;wildly envied&mdash;by
      the three Demoiselles Wermant and the two Misses Sparks, for the handsome
      Gerard, after his first waltz with Madame de Villegry, asked no one to be
      his partner but Mademoiselle de Nailles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls whom he neglected had not even Fred to fall back upon, for Fred,
      the night before, had received orders to join his ship. He had taken leave
      of Jacqueline with a pang in his heart which he could hardly hide, but to
      which no keen emotion on her part seemed to respond. However, at least, he
      was spared the unhappiness of seeing the star of De Cymier rising above
      the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he could only see me,&rdquo; thought Jacqueline, waltzing in triumph with M.
      de Cymier. &ldquo;If he could only see me I should be avenged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he was not Fred. She was not giving him a thought. It was the last
      flash of resentment and hatred that came to her in that moment of triumph,
      adding to it a touch of exquisite enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus she performed the obsequies of her first love!
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after this M. de Nailles said to his wife:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, my dear, that our little Jacqueline is very much admired?
      Her success has been extraordinary. It is not likely she will die an old
      maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baronne assented rather reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wermant was speaking to me the other day,&rdquo; went on M. de Nailles. &ldquo;It
      seems that that young Count de Cymier, who is always hanging around you,
      by the way, has been making inquiries of him, in a manner that looks as if
      it had some meaning, as to what is our fortune, our position. But really,
      such a match seems too good to be true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; said the Baronne. &ldquo;I know more about it than you do, from
      Blanche de Villegry. She gave me to understand that her cousin was much
      struck by Jacqueline at first sight, and ever since she does nothing but
      talk to me of M. de Cymier&mdash;of his birth, his fortune, his abilities&mdash;the
      charming young fellow seems gifted with everything. He could be Secretary
      of Legation, if he liked to quit Paris: In the meantime attache to an
      Embassy looks very well on a card. Attache to the Ministry of the Foreign
      Affairs does not seem so good. Jacqueline would be a countess, possibly an
      ambassadress. What would you think of that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Nailles, who understood policy much better than her husband, had
      suddenly become a convert to opportunism, and had made a change of base.
      Not being able to devise a plan by which to suppress her young rival, she
      had begun to think that her best way to get rid of her would be by
      promoting her marriage. The little girl was fast developing into a woman&mdash;a
      woman who would certainly not consent quietly to be set aside. Well, then,
      it would be best to dispose of her in so natural a way. When Jacqueline&rsquo;s
      slender and graceful figure and the freshness of her bloom were no longer
      brought into close comparison with her own charms, she felt she should
      appear much younger, and should recover some of her prestige; people would
      be less likely to remark her increasing stoutness, or the red spots on her
      face, increased by the salt air which was so favorable to young girls&rsquo; 
      complexions. Yes, Jacqueline must be married; that was the resolution to
      which Madame de Nailles had come after several nights of sleeplessness. It
      was her fixed idea, replacing in her brain that other fixed idea which,
      willingly or unwillingly, she saw she must give up&mdash;the idea of
      keeping her stepdaughter in the shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Countess! Ambassadress!&rdquo; repeated M. de Nailles, with rather a melancholy
      smile. &ldquo;You are going too fast, my dear Clotilde. I don&rsquo;t doubt that
      Wermant gave the best possible account of our situation; but when it comes
      to saying what I could give her as a dot, I am very much afraid. We should
      have, in that case, to fall back on Fred, for I have not told you
      everything. This morning Madame d&rsquo;Argy, who has done nothing but weep
      since her boy went away, and who, she says, never will get accustomed to
      the life of misery and anxiety she will lead as a sailor&rsquo;s mother,
      exclaimed, as she was talking to me: &lsquo;Ah! there is but one way of keeping
      him at Lizerolles, of having him live there as the D&rsquo;Argys have lived
      before him, quietly, like a good landlord, and that would be to give him
      your daughter; with her he would be entirely satisfied.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! so that is the reason why she asked whether Jacqueline might not stay
      with her when we go to Italy! She wishes to court her by proxy. But I
      don&rsquo;t think she will succeed. Monsieur de Cymier has the best chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose the child suspects&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he admires her? My dear friend, we have to do with a very sharp&mdash;sighted
      young person. Nothing escapes the observation of Mademoiselle &lsquo;votre
      fille&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Madame de Nailles, in her turn, smiled somewhat bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jacqueline&rsquo;s father, after a few moments&rsquo; reflection, &ldquo;it may
      be as well that she should weigh for and against a match before deciding.
      She may spend several years that are difficult and dangerous trying to
      find out what she wants and to make up her mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Several years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it! You would not marry off Jacqueline at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! many a girl, practically not as old as she, is married at sixteen or
      seventeen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! I fancied you thought so differently!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our ways of thinking are sometimes altered by events, especially when
      they are founded upon sincere and disinterested affection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like that of good parents, such as we are,&rdquo; added M. de Nailles, ending
      her sentence with an expression of grateful emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one moment the Baronne paled under this compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say to Madame d&rsquo;Argy?&rdquo; she hastened to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said we must give the young fellow&rsquo;s beard time to grow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that was right. I prefer Monsieur de Cymier a hundred times over.
      Still, if nothing better offers&mdash;a bird in the hand, you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Nailles finished her sentence by a wave of her fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! our bird in the hand is not to be despised. A very handsome estate&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where Jacqueline would be bored to death. I should rather see her radiant
      at some foreign court. Let me manage it. Let me bring her out. Give me
      carte blanche and let me have some society this winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Nailles, whether she knew it or not&mdash;probably she did, for
      she had great skill in reading the thoughts of others&mdash;was acting
      precisely in accordance with the wishes or the will of Jacqueline, who,
      having found much enjoyment in the dances at the Casino, had made up her
      mind that she meant to come out into society before any of her young
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not have to beg and implore her,&rdquo; she said to herself,
      anticipating the objections of her stepmother. &ldquo;I shall only have politely
      to let her suspect that such a thing may have occurred as having had a
      listener at a door. I paid dearly enough for this hold over her. I have no
      scruple in using it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Nailles was not mistaken in her stepdaughter; she was very far
      advanced beyond her age, thanks to the cruel wrong that had been done her
      by the loss of her trust in her elders and her respect for them. Her heart
      had had its past, though she was still hardly more than a child&mdash;a
      sad past, though its pain was being rapidly effaced. She now thought about
      it only at intervals. Time and circumstances were operating on her as they
      act upon us generally; only in her case more quickly than usual, which
      produced in her character and feelings phenomena that might have seemed
      curious to an observer. She was something of a woman, something of a
      child, something of a philosopher. At night, when she was dancing with
      Wermant, or Cymier, or even Talbrun, or on horseback, an exercise which
      all the Blues were wild about, she was an audacious flirt, a girl up to
      anything; and in the morning, at low tide, she might be seen, with her
      legs and feet bare, among the children, of whom there were many on the
      sands, digging ditches, making ramparts, constructing towers and
      fortifications in wet sand, herself as much amused as if she had been one
      of the babies themselves. There was screaming and jumping, and rushing out
      of reach of the waves which came up ready to overthrow the most
      complicated labors of the little architects, rough romping of all kinds,
      enough to amaze and disconcert a lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no one could have guessed at the thoughts which, in the midst of all
      this fun and frolic, were passing through the too early ripened mind of
      Jacqueline. She was thinking that many things to which we attach great
      value and importance in this world are as easily swept away as the sand
      barriers raised against the sea by childish hands; that everywhere there
      must be flux and reflux, that the beach the children had so dug up would
      soon become smooth as a mirror, ready for other little ones to dig it over
      again, tempting them to work, and yet discouraging their industry. Her
      heart, she thought, was like the sand, ready for new impressions. The
      elegant form of M. de Cymier slightly overshadowed it, distinct among
      other shadows more confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jacqueline said to herself with a smile, exactly what her father and
      Madame de Nailles had said to each other:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Countess!&mdash;who knows? Ambassadress! Perhaps&mdash;some day&mdash;&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VIII. A PUZZLING CORRESPONDENCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can not see any reason why we should not take Jacqueline with us to
      Italy. She is just of an age to profit by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words were spoken by M. de Nailles after a long silence at the
      breakfast-table. They startled his hearers like a bomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline waited to hear what would come next, fixing a keen look upon
      her stepmother. Their eyes met like the flash of two swords.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the one said: &ldquo;Now, let us hear what you will answer!&rdquo; while
      the other strove to maintain that calmness which comes to some people in a
      moment of danger. The Baroness grew a little pale, and then said, in her
      softest tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right, &lsquo;mon ami&rsquo;, but Jacqueline, I think, prefers to
      stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I decidedly prefer to stay,&rdquo; said Jacqueline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her adversary, much relieved by this response, could not repress a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems singular,&rdquo; said M. de Nailles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! that I prefer to pass a month or six weeks with Madame d&rsquo;Argy?
      Besides, Giselle is going to be married during that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They might put it off until we come back, I should suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t think they would,&rdquo; cried the Baroness. &ldquo;Madame de Monredon is
      so selfish. She was offended to think we should talk of going away on the
      eve of an event she considers so important. Besides, she has so little
      regard for me that I should think her more likely to hasten the
      wedding-day rather than retard it, if it were only for the pleasure of
      giving us a lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry. I should have been glad to be, as she wished, one of
      Giselle&rsquo;s witnesses, but people don&rsquo;t take my position into consideration.
      If I do not take advantage of the recess&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; interrupted Jacqueline, carelessly, &ldquo;your journey must coincide
      with that of Monsieur Marien.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had the pleasure of seeing her stepmother again slightly change color.
      Madame de Nailles was pouring out for herself a cup of tea with singular
      care and attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said M. de Nailles. His daughter pitied him, and cried, with
      an increasing wish to annoy her stepmother: &ldquo;Mamma, don&rsquo;t you see that
      your teapot has no tea in it? Yes,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;it must be delightful to
      travel in Italy in company with a great artist who would explain
      everything; but then one would be expected to visit all the
      picture-galleries, and I hate pictures, since&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused and again looked meaningly at her stepmother, whose soft blue
      eyes showed anguish of spirit, and seemed to say: &ldquo;Oh, what a cruel hold
      she has upon me!&rdquo; Jacqueline continued, carelessly&mdash;&ldquo;Picture-galleries
      I don&rsquo;t care for&mdash;I like nature a hundred times better. Some day I
      should like to take a journey to suit myself, my own journey! Oh, papa,
      may I? A journey on foot with you in the Tyrol?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Nailles was no great walker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both of us, just you and I alone, with our alpenstocks in our hands&mdash;it
      would be lovely! But Italy and painters&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here, with a boyish flourish of her hands, she seemed to send that classic
      land to Jericho!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do promise me, papa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before asking a reward, you must deserve it,&rdquo; said her father, severely,
      who saw something was wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      During her stay at Lizerolles, which her perverseness, her resentment, and
      a repugnance founded on instincts of delicacy, had made her prefer to a
      journey to Italy, Jacqueline, having nothing better to do, took it into
      her head to write to her friend Fred. The young man received three letters
      at three different ports in the Mediterranean and in the West Indies,
      whose names were long associated in his mind with delightful and cruel
      recollections. When the first was handed to him with one from his mother,
      whose letters always awaited him at every stopping-place, the blood flew
      to his face, his heart beat violently, he could have cried aloud but for
      the necessity of self-command in the presence of his comrades, who had
      already remarked in whispers to each other, and with envy, on the pink
      envelope, which exhaled &lsquo;l&rsquo;odor di femina&rsquo;. He hid his treasure quickly,
      and carried it to a spot where he could be alone; then he kissed the bold,
      pointed handwriting that he recognized at once, though never before had it
      written his address. He kissed, too, more than once, the pink seal with a
      J on it, whose slender elegance reminded him of its owner. Hardly did he
      dare to break the seal; then forgetting altogether, as we might be sure,
      his mother&rsquo;s letter, which he knew beforehand was full of good advice and
      expressions of affection, he eagerly read this, which he had not expected
      to receive:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
               &ldquo;LIZEROLLES, October, 5, 188-

   &ldquo;MY DEAR FRED:

   &ldquo;Your mother thinks you would be pleased to receive a letter from
   me, and I hope you will be. You need not answer this if you do not
   care to do so. You will notice, &lsquo;par parenthese&rsquo;, that I take this
   opportunity of saying you and not thou to you. It is easier to
   change the familiar mode of address in writing than in speaking, and
   when we meet again the habit will have become confirmed. But, as I
   write, it will require great attention, and I can not promise to
   keep to it to the end. Half an hour&rsquo;s chat with an old friend will
   also help me to pass the time, which I own seems rather long, as it
   is passed by your sweet, dear mother and myself at Lizerolles. Oh,
   if you were only here it would be different! In the first place,
   we should talk less of a certain Fred, which would be one great
   advantage. You must know that you are the subject of our discourse
   from morning to night; we talk only of the dangers of the seas, the
   future prospects of a seaman, and all the rest of it. If the wind
   is a little higher than usual, your mother begins to cry; she is
   sure you are battling with a tempest. If any fishing-boat is
   wrecked, we talk of nothing but shipwrecks; and I am asked to join
   in another novena, in addition to those with which we must have
   already wearied Notre Dame de Treport. Every evening we spread out
   the map: &lsquo;See, Jacqueline, he must be here now&mdash;no, he is almost
   there,&rsquo; and lines of red ink are traced from one port to another,
   and little crosses are made to show the places where we hope you
   will get your letters&mdash;&lsquo;Poor boy, poor, dear boy!&rsquo; In short,
   notwithstanding all the affectionate interest I take in you, this is
   sometimes too much for me. In fact, I think I must be very fond of
   thee not to have grown positively to hate thee for all this fuss.
   There! In this last sentence, instead of saying you, I have said
   thee! That ought to gild the pill for you!

   &ldquo;We do not go very frequently to visit Treport, except to invoke for
   you the protection of Heaven, and I like it just as well, for since
   the last fortnight in September, which was very rainy, the beach is
   dismal&mdash;so different from what it was in the summer. The town looks
   gloomy under a cloudy sky with its blackened old brick houses! We
   are better off at Lizerolles, whose autumnal beauties you know so
   well that I will say nothing about them.&mdash;Oh, Fred, how often I
   regret that I am not a boy! I could take your gun and go shooting
   in the swamps, where there are clouds of ducks now. I feel sure
   that if you were in my place, you could kill time without killing
   game; but I am at the end of my small resources when I have played a
   little on the piano to amuse your mother and have read her the
   &lsquo;Gazette de France&rsquo;. In the evening we read a translation of some
   English novel. There are neighbors, of course, old fogies who stay
   all the year round in Picardy&mdash;but, tell me, don&rsquo;t you find them
   sometimes a little too respectable? My greatest comfort is in your
   dog, who loves me as much as if I were his master, though I can not
   take him out shooting. While I write he is lying on the hem of my
   gown and makes a little noise, as much as to tell me that I recall
   you to his remembrance. Yet you are not to suppose that I am
   suffering from ennui, or am ungrateful, nor above all must you
   imagine that I have ceased to love your excellent mother with all my
   heart. I love her, on the contrary, more than ever since I passed
   this winter through a great, great sorrow&mdash;a sorrow which is now
   only a sad remembrance, but which has changed for me the face of
   everything in this world. Yes, since I have suffered myself, I
   understand your mother. I admire her, I love her more than ever.

   &ldquo;How happy you are, my dear Fred, to have such a sweet mother,&mdash;
   a real mother who never thinks about her face, or her figure, or her
   age, but only of the success of her son; a dear little mother in a
   plain black gown, and with pretty gray hair, who has the manners and
   the toilette that just suit her, who somehow always seems to say:
   &lsquo;I care for nothing but that which affects my son.&rsquo; Such mothers are
   rare, believe me. Those that I know, the mothers of my friends, are
   for the most part trying to appear as young as their daughters&mdash;nay,
   prettier, and of course more elegant. When they have sons they make
   them wear jackets a l&rsquo;anglaise and turn-down collars, up to the age
   when I wore short skirts. Have you noticed that nowadays in Paris
   there are only ladies who are young, or who are trying to make
   themselves appear so? Up to the last moment they powder and paint,
   and try to make themselves different from what age has made them.
   If their hair was black it grows blacker&mdash;if red, it is more red.
   But there is no longer any gray hair in Paris&mdash;it is out of fashion.
   That is the reason why I think your mother&rsquo;s pretty silver curls so
   lovely and &lsquo;distingues&rsquo;. I kiss them every night for you, after I
   have kissed them for myself.

   &ldquo;Have a good voyage, come back soon, and take care of yourself, dear
   Fred.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The young sailor read this letter over and over again. The more he read it
      the more it puzzled him. Most certainly he felt that Jacqueline gave him a
      great proof of confidence when she spoke to him of some mysterious
      unhappiness, an unhappiness of which it was evident her stepmother was the
      cause. He could see that much; but he was infinitely far from suspecting
      the nature of the woes to which she alluded. Poor Jacqueline! He pitied
      her without knowing what for, with a great outburst of sympathy, and an
      honest desire to do anything in the world to make her happy. Was it really
      possible that she could have been enduring any grief that summer when she
      had seemed so madly gay, so ready for a little flirtation? Young girls
      must be very skilful in concealing their inmost feelings! When he was
      unhappy he had it out by himself, he took refuge in solitude, he wanted to
      be done with existence. Everybody knew when anything went wrong with him.
      Why could not Jacqueline have let him know more plainly what it was that
      troubled her, and why could she not have shown a little tenderness toward
      him, instead of assuming, even when she said the kindest things to him,
      her air of mockery? And then, though she might pretend not to find
      Lizerolles stupid, he could see that she was bored there. Yet why had she
      chosen to stay at Lizerolles rather than go to Italy?
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! how that little pink letter made him reflect and guess, and turn
      things over in his mind, and wish himself at the devil&mdash;that little
      pink letter which he carried day and night on his breast and made it
      crackle as it lay there, when he laid his hand on the satin folds so near
      his heart! It had an odor of sweet violets which seemed to him to
      overpower the smell of pitch and of salt water, to fill the air, to
      perfume everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That young fellow has the instincts of a sailor,&rdquo; said his superior
      officers when they saw him standing in attitudes which they thought
      denoted observation, though with him it was only reverie. He would stand
      with his eyes fixed upon some distant point, whence he fancied he could
      see emerging from the waves a small, brown, shining head, with long hair
      streaming behind, the head of a girl swimming, a girl he knew so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can see that he takes an interest in nautical phenomena, that he is
      heart and soul in his profession, that he cares for nothing else. Oh,
      he&rsquo;ll make a sailor! We may be sure of that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fred sent his young friend and cousin, by way of reply, a big packet of
      manuscript, the leaves of which were of all sizes, over which he had
      poured forth torrents of poetry, amorous and descriptive, under the title:
      At Sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never would he have dared to show her this if the ocean had not lain
      between them. He was frightened when his packet had been sent. His only
      comfort was in the thought that he had hypocritically asked Jacqueline for
      her literary opinion of his verses; but she could not fail, he thought, to
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before an answer could have been expected, he got another letter,
      sky-blue this time, much longer than the first, giving him an account of
      Giselle&rsquo;s wedding.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Your mother and I went together to Normandy, where the marriage was
   to take place after the manner of old times, &lsquo;in the fashion of the
   Middle Ages,&rsquo; as our friends the Wermants said to me, who might
   perhaps not have laughed at it had they been invited. Madame de
   Monredon is all for old customs, and she had made it a great point
   that the wedding should not take place in Paris. Had I been
   Giselle, I should not have liked it. I know nothing more elegant or
   more solemn than the entrance of a bridal party into the Madeleine,
   but we shall have to be content with Saint-Augustin. Still, the
   toilettes, as they pass up the aisle, even there, are very
   effective, and the decoration of the tall, high altar is
   magnificent. Toc! Toc! First come the beadles with their
   halberds, then the loud notes of the organ, then the wide doors are
   thrown open, making a noise as they turn on their great hinges,
   letting the noise of carriages outside be heard in the church; and
   then comes the bride in a ray of sunshine. I could wish for nothing
   more. A grand wedding in the country is much more quiet, but it is
   old-fashioned. In the little village church the guests were very
   much crowded, and outside there was a great mob of country folk.
   Carpets had been laid down over the dilapidated pavement, composed
   principally of tombstones. The rough walls were hung with scarlet.
   All the clergy of the neighborhood were present. A Monsignor&mdash;
   related to the Talbruns&mdash;pronounced the nuptial benediction; his
   address was a panegyric on the two families. He gave us to
   understand that if he did not go back quite as far as the Crusades,
   it was only because time was wanting.

   &ldquo;Madame de Monredon was all-glorious, of course. She certainly
   looked like an old vulture, in a pelisse of gray velvet, with a
   chinchilla boa round her long, bare neck, and her big beak, with
   marabouts overshadowing it, of the same color. Monsieur de Talbrun
   &mdash;well! Monsieur de Talbrun was very bald, as bald as he could be.
   To make up for the want of hair on his head, he has plenty of it on
   his hands. It is horrid, and it makes him look like an animal. You
   have no idea how queer he looked when he sat down, with his big,
   pink head just peeping over the back of the crimson velvet chair,
   which was, however, almost as tall as he is. He is short, you may
   remember. As to our poor Giselle, the prettiest persons sometimes
   look badly as brides, and those who are not pretty look ugly. Do
   you recollect that picture&mdash;by Velasquez, is it not? of a fair
   little Infanta stiffly swathed in cloth of gold, as becomes her
   dignity, and looking crushed by it? Giselle&rsquo;s gown was of point
   d&rsquo;Alencon, old family lace as yellow as ancient parchment, but of
   inestimable value. Her long corsage, made in the fashion of Anne of
   Austria, looked on her like a cuirass, and she dragged after her,
   somewhat awkwardly, a very long train, which impeded her movement as
   she walked. A lace veil, as hereditary and time-worn as the gown,
   but which had been worn by all the Monredons at their weddings, the
   present dowager&rsquo;s included, hid the pretty, light hair of our dear
   little friend, and was supported by a sort of heraldic comb and some
   orange-flowers; in short, you can not imagine anything more heavy or
   more ugly. Poor Giselle, loaded down with it, had red eyes, a face
   of misery, and the air of a martyr. For all this her grandmother
   scolded her sharply, which of course did not mend matters. &lsquo;Du
   reste&rsquo;, she seemed absorbed in prayer or thought during the
   ceremony, in which I took up the offerings, by the way, with a young
   lieutenant of dragoons just out of the military school at Saint Cyr:
   a uniform always looks well on such occasions. Nor was Monsieur de
   Talbrun one of those lukewarm Christians who hear mass with their
   arms crossed and their noses in the air. He pulled a jewelled
   prayerbook out of his pocket, which Giselle had given him. Speaking
   of presents, those he gave her were superb: pearls as big as
   hazelnuts, a ruby heart that was a marvel, a diamond crescent that I
   am afraid she will never wear with such an air as it deserves, and
   two strings of diamonds &lsquo;en riviere&rsquo;, which I should suppose she
   would have reset, for rivieres are no longer in fashion. The stones
   are enormous.

   &ldquo;But, poor dear! she could care little for such things. All she
   wanted was to get back as quickly as she could into her usual
   clothes. She said to me, again and again: &lsquo;Pray God for me that I
   may be a good wife. I am so afraid I may not be. To belong to
   Monsieur de Talbrun in this world, and in the next; to give up
   everything for him, seems so extraordinary. Indeed, I think I
   hardly knew what I was promising.&rsquo; I felt sorry for her; I kissed
   her. I was ready to cry myself, and poor Giselle went on: &lsquo;If you
   knew, dear, how I love you! how I love all my friends! really to
   love, people must have been brought up together&mdash;must have always
   known each other.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t think she was right, but everybody has
   his or her ideas about such things. I tried, by way of consoling
   her, to draw her attention to the quantities of presents she had
   received. They were displayed on several tables in the smaller
   drawing-room, but her grandmother would not let them put the name of
   the giver upon each, as is the present custom. She said that it
   humiliated those who had not been able to make gifts as expensive as
   others. She is right, when one comes to think of it. Nor would she
   let the trousseau be displayed; she did not think it proper, but I
   saw enough to know that there were marvels in linen, muslin, silks,
   and surahs, covered all over with lace. One could see that the
   great mantua-maker had not consulted the grandmother, who says that
   women of distinction in her day did not wear paltry trimmings.

   &ldquo;Dinner was served under a tent for all the village people during
   the two mortal hours we had to spend over a repast, in which Madame
   de Monredon&rsquo;s cook excelled himself. Then came complimentary
   addresses in the old-fashioned style, composed by the village
   schoolmaster who, for a wonder, knew what he was about; groups of
   village children, boys and girls, came bringing their offerings,
   followed by pet lambs decked with ribbons; it was all in the style
   of the days of Madame de Genlis. While we danced in the salons
   there was dancing in the barn, which had been decorated for the
   occasion. In short; lords and ladies and laborers all seemed to
   enjoy themselves, or made believe they did. The Parisian gentlemen
   who danced were not very numerous. There were a few friends of
   Monsieur de Talbrun&rsquo;s, however&mdash;among them, a Monsieur de Cymier,
   whom possibly you remember having seen last summer at Treport; he
   led the cotillon divinely. The bride and bridegroom drove away
   during the evening, as they do in England, to their own house, which
   is not far off. Monsieur de Talbrun&rsquo;s horses&mdash;a magnificent pair,
   harnessed to a new &lsquo;caleche&rsquo;&mdash;carried off Psyche, as an old
   gentleman in gold spectacles said near me. He was a pretentious old
   personage, who made a speech at table, very inappropriate and much
   applauded. Poor Giselle! I have not seen her since, but she has
   written me one of those little notes which, when she was in the
   convent, she used to sign Enfant de Marie. It begged me again to
   pray earnestly for her that she might not fail in the fulfilment of
   her new duties. It seems hard, does it not? Let us hope that
   Monsieur de Talbrun, on his part, may not find that his new life
   rather wearies him! Do you know what should have been Giselle&rsquo;s
   fate&mdash;since she has a mania about people being thoroughly acquainted
   before marriage? What would two or three years more or less have
   mattered? She would have made an admirable wife for a sailor; she
   would have spent the months of your absence kneeling before the
   altar; she would have multiplied the lamentations and the
   tendernesses of your excellent mother. I have been thinking this
   ever since the wedding-day&mdash;a very sad day, after all.

   &ldquo;But how I have let my pen run on. I shall have to put on two
   stamps, notwithstanding my thin paper. But then you have plenty of
   time to read on board-ship, and this account may amuse you. Make
   haste and thank me for it.

                  &ldquo;Your old friend,

                       &ldquo;JACQUELINE.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Amuse him! How could he be amused by so great an insult? What! thank her
      for giving him over even in thought to Giselle or to anybody? Oh, how
      wicked, how ungrateful, how unworthy!
    </p>
    <p>
      The six pages of foreign-post paper were crumpled up by his angry fingers.
      Fred tore them with his teeth, and finally made them into a ball which he
      flung into the sea, hating himself for having been so foolish as to let
      himself be caught by the first lines, as a foolish fish snaps at the bait,
      when, apropos to the church in which she would like to be married, she had
      added &ldquo;But we should have to be content with Saint-Augustin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those words had delighted him as if they had really been meant for himself
      and Jacqueline. This promise for the future, that seemed to escape
      involuntarily from her pen, had made him find all the rest of her letter
      piquant and amusing. As he read, his mind had reverted to that little
      phrase which he now found he had interpreted wrongly. What a fall! How his
      hopes now crumbled under his feet! She must have done it on purpose&mdash;but
      no, he need not blacken her! She had written without thought, without
      purpose, in high spirits; she wanted to be witty, to be droll, to write
      gossip without any reference to him to whom her letter was addressed. That
      we who some day would make a triumphal entry into St. Augustin would be
      herself and some other man&mdash;some man with whom her acquaintance had
      been short, since she did not seem to feel in that matter like Giselle.
      Some one she did not yet know? Was that sure? She might know her future
      husband already, even now she might have made her choice&mdash;Marcel
      d&rsquo;Etaples, perhaps, who looked so well in uniform, or that M. de Cymier,
      who led the cotillon so divinely. Yes! No doubt it was he&mdash;the
      last-comer. And once more Fred suffered all the pangs of jealousy. It
      seemed to him that in his loneliness, between sky and sea, those pangs
      were more acute than he had ever known them. His comrades teased him about
      his melancholy looks, and made him the butt of all their jokes in the
      cockpit. He resolved, however, to get over it, and at the next port they
      put into, Jacqueline&rsquo;s letter was the cause of his entering for the first
      time some discreditable scenes of dissipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Bermuda he received another letter, dated from Paris, where Jacqueline
      had rejoined her parents, who had returned from Italy. She sent him a
      commission. Would he buy her a riding-whip? Bermuda was renowned for its
      horsewhips, and her father had decided that she must go regularly to the
      riding-school. They seemed anxious now to give her, as preliminary to her
      introduction into society, not only such pleasures as horseback exercise,
      but intellectual enjoyment also. She had been taken to the Institute to
      hear M. Legouve, and what was better still, in December her stepmother
      would give a little party every fortnight and would let her sit up till
      eleven o&rsquo;clock. She was also to be taken to make some calls. In short, she
      felt herself rising in importance, but the first thing that had made her
      feel so was Fred&rsquo;s choice of her to be his literary confidant. She was
      greatly obliged to him, and did not know how she could better prove to him
      that she was worthy of so great an honor than by telling him quite frankly
      just what she thought of his verses. They were very, very pretty. He had
      talent&mdash;great talent. Only, as in attending the classes of M. Regis
      she had acquired some little knowledge of the laws of versification, she
      would like to warn him against impairing a thought for the benefit of a
      rhyme, and she pointed out several such places in his compositions, ending
      thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo! for sunsets, for twilights, for moonshine, for deep silence, for
      starry nights, and silvery seas&mdash;in such things you excel; one feels
      as if one were there, and one envies you the fairy scenes of ocean. But, I
      implore you, be not sentimental. That is the feeble part of your poetry,
      to my thinking, and spoils the rest. By the way, I should like to ask you
      whose are those soft eyes, that silky hair, that radiant smile, and all
      that assortment of amber, jet, and coral occurring so often in your
      visions? Is she&mdash;or rather, are they&mdash;black, yellow, green, or
      tattooed, for, of course, you have met everywhere beauties of all colors?
      Several times when it appeared as if the lady of your dreams were white, I
      fancied you were drawing a portrait of Isabelle Ray. All the girls, your
      old friends, to whom I have shown At Sea, send you their compliments, to
      which I join my own. Each of them will beg you to write her a sonnet; but
      first of all, in virtue of our ancient friendship, I want one myself.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                         &ldquo;JACQUELINE.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      So! she had shown to others what was meant for her alone; what
      profanation! And what was more abominable, she had not recognized that he
      was speaking of herself. Ah! there was nothing to be done now but to
      forget her. Fred tried to do so conscientiously during all his cruise in
      the Atlantic, but the moment he got ashore and had seen Jacqueline, he
      fell again a victim to her charms.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. BEAUTY AT THE FAIR
    </h2>
    <p>
      She was more beautiful than ever, and her first exclamation on seeing him
      was intended to be flattering: &ldquo;Ah! Fred, how much you have improved! But
      what a change! What an extraordinary change! Why, look at him! He is still
      himself, but who would have thought it was Fred!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was not disconcerted, for he had acquired aplomb in his journeys round
      the globe, but he gave her a glance of sad reproach, while Madame de
      Nailles said, quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, really&mdash;How are you, Fred? The tan on your face is very
      becoming to you. You have broadened at the shoulders, and are now a man&mdash;something
      more than a man, an experienced sailor, almost an old seadog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she laughed, but only softly, because a frank laugh would have shown
      little wrinkles under her eyes and above her cheeks, which were getting
      too large.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her toilette, which was youthful, yet very carefully adapted to her
      person, showed that she was by no means as yet &ldquo;laid on the shelf,&rdquo; as
      Raoul Wermant elegantly said of her. She stood up, leaning over a table
      covered with toys, which it was her duty to sell at the highest price
      possible, for the place of a meeting so full of emotions for Fred was a
      charity bazaar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment he arrived in Paris the young officer had been, so to speak,
      seized by the collar. He had found a great glazed card, bidding him to
      attend this fair, in a fashionable quarter, and forthwith he had forgotten
      his resolution of not going near the Nailles for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not the same thing,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;One must not let one&rsquo;s
      self be supposed to be stingy.&rdquo; So with these thoughts he went to the
      bazaar, very glad in his secret heart to have an excuse for breaking his
      resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fair was for the benefit of sufferers from a fire&mdash;somewhere or
      other. In our day multitudes of people fall victims to all kinds of
      dreadful disasters, explosions of boilers, explosions of fire-damp, of
      everything that can explode, for the agents of destruction seem to be in a
      state of unnatural excitement as well as human beings. Never before,
      perhaps, have inanimate things seemed so much in accordance with the
      spirit of the times. Fred found a superb placard, the work of Cheret, a
      pathetic scene in a mine, banners streaming in the air, with the words
      &lsquo;Bazar de Charite&rsquo; in gold letters on a red ground, and the courtyard of
      the mansion where the fair was held filled with more carriages than one
      sees at a fashionable wedding. In the vestibule many footmen were in
      attendance, the chasseurs of an Austrian ambassador, the great hulking
      fellows of the English embassy, the gray-liveried servants of old
      Rozenkranz, with their powdered heads, the negro man belonging to Madame
      Azucazillo, etc., etc. At each arrival there was a frou-frou of satin and
      lace, and inside the sales room was a hubbub like the noise in an aviary.
      Fred, finding himself at once in the full stream of Parisian life, but for
      the moment not yet part of it, indulged in some of those philosophic
      reflections to which he had been addicted on shipboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of the tables showed something of the tastes, the character, the
      peculiarities of the lady who had it in charge. Madame Sterny, who had the
      most beautiful hands in the world, had undertaken to sell gloves, being
      sure that the gentlemen would be eager to buy if she would only consent to
      try them on; Madame de Louisgrif, the &lsquo;chanoiness&rsquo;, whose extreme
      emaciation was not perceived under a sort of ecclesiastical cape, had an
      assortment of embroideries and objects of devotion, intended only for
      ladies&mdash;and indeed for only the most serious among them; for the
      table that held umbrellas, parasols and canes suited to all ages and both
      sexes, a good, upright little lady had been chosen. Her only thought was
      how much money she could make by her sales. Madame Strahlberg, the oldest
      of the Odinskas, obviously expected to sell only to gentlemen; her table
      held pyramids of cigars and cigarettes, but nothing else was in the corner
      where she presided, supple and frail, not handsome, but far more dangerous
      than if she had been, with her unfathomable way of looking at you with her
      light eyes set deep under her eyebrows, eyes that she kept half closed,
      but which were yet so keen, and the cruel smile that showed her little
      sharp teeth. Her dress was of black grenadine embroidered with silver. She
      wore half mourning as a sort of announcement that she was a widow, in
      hopes that this might put a stop to any wicked gossip which should assert
      that Count Strahlberg was still living, having got a divorce and been very
      glad to get it. Yet people talked about her, but hardly knew what to bring
      against her, because, though anything might be suspected, nothing was
      known. She was received and even sought after in the best society, on
      account of her wonderful talents, which she employed in a manner as
      perverse as everything else about her, but which led some people to call
      her the &lsquo;Judic des salons&rsquo;. Wanda Strahlberg was now holding between her
      lips, which were artificially red, in contrast to the greenish paleness of
      her face, which caused others to call her a vampire, one of the cigarettes
      she had for sale. With one hand, she was playing, graceful as a cat, with
      her last package of regalias, tied with green ribbon, which, when offered
      to the highest bidder, brought an enormous sum. Her sister Colette was
      selling flowers, like several other young girls, but while for the most
      part these waited on their customers in silence, she was full of lively
      talk, and as unblushing in her eagerness to sell as a &lsquo;bouquetiere&rsquo; by
      profession. She had grown dangerously pretty. Fred was dazzled when she
      wanted to fasten a rose into his buttonhole, and then, as he paid for it,
      gave him another, saying: &ldquo;And here is another thrown in for old
      acquaintance&rsquo; sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charity seems to cover many things,&rdquo; thought the young man as he withdrew
      from her smiles and her glances, but yet he had seen nothing so attractive
      among the black, yellow, green or tattooed ladies about whom Jacqueline
      had been pleased to tease him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fred!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Jacqueline&rsquo;s voice that arrested him. It was sharp and almost
      angry. She, too, was selling flowers, while at the same time she was
      helping Madame de Nailles with her toys; but she was selling with that
      decorum and graceful reserve which custom prescribes for young girls.
      &ldquo;Fred, I do hope you will wear no roses but mine. Those you have are
      frightful. They make you look like a village bridegroom. Take out those
      things; come! Here is a pretty boutonniere, and I will fasten it much
      better in your buttonhole&mdash;let me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In vain did he try to seem cold to her; his heart thawed in spite of
      himself. She held him so charmingly by the lapel of his coat, touching his
      cheek with the tip end of an aigrette which set so charmingly on the top
      of the most becoming of fur caps which she wore. Her hair was turned up
      now, showing her beautiful neck, and he could see little rebellious hairs
      curling at their own will over her pure, soft skin, while she, bending
      forward, was engaged in his service. He admired, too, her slender waist,
      only recently subjected to the restraint of a corset. He forgave her on
      the spot. At this moment a man with brown hair, tall, elegant, and with
      his moustache turned up at the ends, after the old fashion of the Valois,
      revived recently, came hurriedly up to the table of Madame de Nailles.
      Fred felt that that inimitable moustache reduced his not yet abundant
      beard to nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Jacqueline,&rdquo; said the newcomer, &ldquo;Madame de Villegry has sent
      me to beg you to help her at the buffet. She can not keep pace with her
      customers, and is asking for volunteers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this was uttered with a familiar assurance which greatly shocked the
      young naval man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You permit me, Madame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness bowed with a smile, which said, had he chosen to interpret
      it, &ldquo;I give you permission to carry her off now&mdash;and forever, if you
      wish it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment she was placing in the half-unwilling arms of Hubert Marien
      an enormous rubber balloon and a jumping-jack, in return for five Louis
      which he had laid humbly on her table. But Jacqueline had not waited for
      her stepmother&rsquo;s permission; she let herself be borne off radiant on the
      arm of the important personage who had come for her, while Colette, who
      perhaps had remarked the substitution for her two roses, whispered in
      Fred&rsquo;s ear, in atone of great significance &ldquo;Monsieur de Cymier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor fellow started, like a man suddenly awakened from a happy dream
      to face the most unwelcome of realities. Impelled by that natural longing,
      that we all have, to know the worst, he went toward the buffet, affecting
      a calmness which it cost him a great effort to maintain. As he went along
      he mechanically gave money to each of the ladies whom he knew, moving off
      without waiting for their thanks or stopping to choose anything from their
      tables. He seemed to feel the floor rock under his feet, as if he had been
      walking the deck of a vessel. At last he reached a recess decorated with
      palms, where, in a robe worthy of &lsquo;Peau d&rsquo;Ane&rsquo; in the story, and
      absolutely a novelty in the world of fashions robe all embroidered with
      gold and rubies, which glittered with every movement made by the wearer&mdash;Madame
      de Villegry was pouring out Russian tea and Spanish chocolate and Turkish
      coffee, while all kinds of deceitful promises of favor shone in her eyes,
      which wore a certain tenderness expressive of her interest in charity. A
      party of young nymphs formed the court of this fair goddess, doing their
      best to lend her their aid. Jacqueline was one of them, and, at the moment
      Fred approached, she was offering, with the tips of her fingers, a glass
      of champagne to M. de Cymier, who at the same time was eagerly trying to
      persuade her to believe something, about which she was gayly laughing,
      while she shook her head. Poor Fred, that he might hear, and suffer, drank
      two mouthfuls of sherry which he could hardly swallow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One who was really charitable would not hesitate,&rdquo; said M. de Cymier,
      &ldquo;especially when every separate hair would be paid for if you chose. Just
      one little curl&mdash;for the sake of the poor. It is very often done:
      anything is allowable for the sake of the poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe it is because, as you say, that it is very often done that I shall
      not do it,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, still laughing. &ldquo;I have made up my mind never
      to do what others have done before me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we shall see,&rdquo; said M. de Cymier, pretending to threaten her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And her young head was thrown back in a burst of inextinguishable
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred fled, that he might not be tempted to make a disturbance. When he
      found himself again in the street, he asked himself where he should go.
      His anger choked him; he felt he could not keep his resentment to himself,
      and yet, however angry he might be with Jacqueline, he would have been
      unwilling to hear his mother give utterance to the very sentiments that he
      was feeling, or to harsh judgments, of which he preferred to keep the
      monopoly. It came into his mind that he would pay a little visit to
      Giselle, who, of all the people he knew, was the least likely to provoke a
      quarrel. He had heard that Madame de Talbrun did not go out, being
      confined to her sofa by much suffering, which, it might be hoped, would
      soon come to an end; and the certainty that he should find her if he
      called at once decided him. Since he had been in Paris he had done nothing
      but leave cards. This time, however, he was sure that the lady upon whom
      he called would be at home. He was taken at once into the young wife&rsquo;s
      boudoir, where he found her very feeble, lying back upon her cushions,
      alone, and working at some little bits of baby-clothes. He was not slow to
      perceive that she was very glad to see him. She flushed with pleasure as
      he came into the room, and, dropping her sewing, held out to him two
      little, thin hands, white as wax. &ldquo;Take that footstool&mdash;sit down
      there&mdash;what a great, great pleasure it is to see you back again!&rdquo; She
      was more expansive than she had been formerly; she had gained a certain
      ease which comes from intercourse with the world, but how delicate she
      seemed! Fred for a moment looked at her in silence, she seemed so changed
      as she lay there in a loose robe of pale blue cashmere, whose train drawn
      over her feet made her look tall as it stretched to the end of the gilded
      couch, round which Giselle had collected all the little things required by
      an invalid&mdash;bottles, boxes, work-bag, dressing-case, and writing
      materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said, with her soft smile, &ldquo;I have plenty to occupy me, and
      I venture to be proud of my work and to think I am creating marvels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke she turned round on her closed hand a cap that seemed
      microscopic to Fred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;do you expect him to be small enough to wear that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him! you said him; and I am sure you will be right. I know it will be a
      boy,&rdquo; replied Giselle, eagerly, her fair face brightened by these words.
      &ldquo;I have some that are still smaller. Look!&rdquo; and she lifted up a pile of
      things trimmed with ribbons and embroidery. &ldquo;See; these are the first! Ah!
      I lie here and fancy how he will look when he has them on. He will be
      sweet enough to eat. Only his papa wants us to give him a name that I
      think is too long for him, because it has always been in the family&mdash;Enguerrand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name will be longer than himself, I should say, judging by the
      dimensions of this cap,&rdquo; said Fred, trying to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; replied Giselle, gayly, &ldquo;but we can get over it by calling him
      Gue-gue or Ra-ra. What do you think? The difficulty is that names of that
      kind are apt to stick to a boy for fifty years, and then they seem
      ridiculous. Now a pretty abbreviation like Fred is another matter. But I
      forget they have brought up my chocolate. Please ring, and let them bring
      you a cup. We will take our luncheon together, as we used to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, I have no appetite. I have just come from a certain buffet
      where I lost it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I suppose you have been to the Bazaar&mdash;the famous Charity Fair!
      You must have made a sensation there on your return, for I am told that
      the gentlemen who are expected to spend the most are likely to send their
      money, and not to show themselves. There are many complaints of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were plenty of men round certain persons,&rdquo; replied Fred, dryly.
      &ldquo;Madame de Villegry&rsquo;s table was literally besieged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really! What, hers! You surprise me! So it was the good things she gave
      you that make you despise my poor chocolate,&rdquo; said Giselle, rising on her
      elbow, to receive the smoking cup that a servant brought her on a little
      silver salver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take much at her table,&rdquo; said Fred, ready to enter on his
      grievances. &ldquo;If you wish to know the reason why, I was too indignant to
      eat or drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indignant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the word is not at all too strong. When one has passed whole months
      away from what is unwholesome and artificial, such things as make up life
      in Paris, one becomes a little like Alceste, Moliere&rsquo;s misanthrope, when
      one gets back to them. It is ridiculous at my age, and yet if I were to
      tell you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&mdash;you puzzle me. What can there be that is unwholesome in
      selling things for the poor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor! A pretty pretext! Was it to benefit the poor that that odious
      Countess Strahlberg made all those disreputable grimaces? I have seen
      kermesses got up by actresses, and, upon my word, they were good form in
      comparison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Countess Strahlberg! People have heard about her doings until they
      are tired of them,&rdquo; said Giselle, with that air of knowing everything
      assumed by a young wife whose husband has told her all the current
      scandals, as a sort of initiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And her sister seems likely to be as bad as herself before long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Colette! She has been so badly brought up. It is not her fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s Jacqueline,&rdquo; cried Fred, in a sudden outburst, and already
      feeling better because he could mention her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allons, donc! You don&rsquo;t mean to say anything against Jacqueline?&rdquo; cried
      Giselle, clasping her hands with an air of astonishment. &ldquo;What can she
      have done to scandalize you&mdash;poor little dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fred paused for half a minute, then he drew the stool in the form of an X,
      on which he was sitting, a little nearer to Giselle&rsquo;s sofa, and, lowering
      his voice, told her how Jacqueline had acted under his very eyes. As he
      went on, watching as he spoke the effect his words produced upon Giselle,
      who listened as if slightly amused by his indignation, the case seemed not
      nearly so bad as he had supposed, and a delicious sense of relief crept
      over him when she to whom he told his wrongs after hearing him quietly to
      the end, said, smiling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what then? There is no great harm in all that. Would you have had her
      refuse to go with the gentleman Madame de Villegry had sent to fetch her?
      And why, may I ask, should she not have done her best to help by pouring
      out champagne? An air put on to please is indispensable to a woman, if she
      wishes to sell anything. Good Heavens! I don&rsquo;t approve any more than you
      do of all these worldly forms of charity, but this kind of thing is
      considered right; it has come into fashion. Jacqueline had the permission
      of her parents, and I really can&rsquo;t see any good reason why you should
      complain of her. Unless&mdash;why not tell me the whole truth, Fred? I
      know it&mdash;don&rsquo;t we always know what concerns the people that we care
      for? And I might possibly some day be of use to you. Say! don&rsquo;t you think
      you are&mdash;a little bit jealous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Less encouragement than this would have sufficed to make him open his
      heart to Giselle. He was delighted that some woman was willing he should
      confide in her. And what was more, he was glad to have it proved that he
      had been all wrong. A quarter of an hour later Giselle had comforted him,
      happy herself that it had been in her power to undertake a task of
      consolation, a work in which, with sweet humility, she felt herself at
      ease. On the great stage of life she knew now she should never play any
      important part, any that would bring her greatly into view. But she felt
      that she was made to be a confidant, one of those perfect confidants who
      never attempt to interfere rashly with the course of events, but who wait
      upon the ways of Providence, removing stones, and briers and thorns, and
      making everything turn out for the best in the end. Jacqueline, she said,
      was so young! A little wild, perhaps, but what a treasure! She was all
      heart! She would need a husband worthy of her, such a man as Fred. Madame
      d&rsquo;Argy, she knew, had already said something on the subject to her father.
      But it would have to be the Baroness that Fred must bring over to their
      views; the Baroness was acquiring more and more influence over her
      husband, who seemed to be growing older every day. M. de Nailles had
      evidently much, very much upon his mind. It was said in business circles
      that he had for some time past been given to speculation. Oscar said so.
      If that were the case, many of Jacqueline&rsquo;s suitors might withdraw. Not
      all men were so disinterested as Fred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! As to her dot&mdash;what do I care for her dot?&rdquo; cried the young man.
      &ldquo;I have enough for two, if she would only be satisfied to live quietly at
      Lizerolles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the judicious little matron, nodding her head, &ldquo;but who would
      like to marry a midshipman? Make haste and be a lieutenant, or an ensign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at herself for having made the reward depend upon exertion,
      with a sort of maternal instinct. It was the same instinct that would lead
      her in the future to promise Enguerrand a sugar-plum if he said his
      lesson. &ldquo;Nobody will steal your Jacqueline till you are ready to carry her
      off. Besides, if there were any danger I could give you timely warning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Giselle, if she only had your kind heart&mdash;your good sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I am better and more reasonable than other people? In what
      way? I have done as so many other girls do; I have married without knowing
      well what I was doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped short, fearing she might have said too much, and indeed Fred
      looked at her anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t regret it, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must ask Monsieur de Talbrun if he regrets it,&rdquo; she said, with a
      laugh. &ldquo;It must be hard on him to have a sick wife, who knows little of
      what is passing outside of her own chamber, who is living on her reserve
      fund of resources&mdash;a very poor little reserve fund it is, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as if she thought that Fred had been with her long enough, she said:
      &ldquo;I would ask you to stay and see Monsieur de Talbrun, but he won&rsquo;t be in,
      he dines at his club. He is going to see a new play tonight which they say
      promises to be very good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Will he leave you alone all the evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I am very glad he should find amusement. Just think how long it is
      that I have been pinned down here! Poor Oscar!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. GISELLE&rsquo;S CONSOLATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The arrival of the expected Enguerrand hindered Giselle from pleading
      Fred&rsquo;s cause as soon as she could have wished. Her life for twenty-four
      hours was in great danger, and when the crisis was past, which M. de
      Talbrun treated very indifferently, as a matter of course, her first cry
      was &ldquo;My baby!&rdquo; uttered in a tone of tender eagerness such as had never
      been heard from her lips before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse brought him. He lay asleep swathed in his swaddling clothes like
      a mummy in its wrappings, a motionless, mysterious being, but he seemed to
      his mother beautiful&mdash;more beautiful than anything she had seen in
      those vague visions of happiness she had indulged in at the convent, which
      were never to be realized. She kissed his little purple face, his closed
      eyelids, his puckered mouth, with a sort of respectful awe. She was
      forbidden to fatigue herself. The wet-nurse, who had been brought from
      Picardy, drew near with her peasant cap trimmed with long blue streamers;
      her big, experienced hands took the baby from his mother, she turned him
      over on her lap, she patted him, she laughed at him. And the
      mother-happiness that had lighted up Giselle&rsquo;s pale face died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What right,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;has that woman to my child?&rdquo; She envied the
      horrid creature, coarse and stout, with her tanned face, her bovine
      features, her shapeless figure, who seemed as if Nature had predestined
      her to give milk and nothing more. Giselle would so gladly have been in
      her place! Why wouldn&rsquo;t they permit her to nurse her baby?
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Talbrun said in answer to this question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is never done among people in our position. You have no idea, of all
      it would entail on you&mdash;what slavery, what fatigue! And most probably
      you would not have had milk enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! who can tell? I am his mother! And when this woman goes he will have
      to have English nurses, and when he is older he will have to go to school.
      When shall I have him to myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she began to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; said M. de Talbrun, much astonished, &ldquo;all this fuss about
      that frightful little monkey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giselle looked at him almost as much astonished as he had been at her.
      Love, with its jealousy, its transports, its anguish, its delights had for
      the first time come to her&mdash;the love that she could not feel for her
      husband awoke in her for her son. She was ennobled&mdash;she was
      transfigured by a sense of her maternity; it did for her what marriage
      does for some women&mdash;it seemed as if a sudden radiance surrounded
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she raised her infant in her arms, to show him to those who came to
      see her, she always seemed like a most chaste and touching representation
      of the Virgin Mother. She would say, as she exhibited him: &ldquo;Is he not
      superb?&rdquo; Every one said: &ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo; out of politeness, but, on leaving
      the mother&rsquo;s presence, would generally remark: &ldquo;He is Monsieur de Talbrun
      in baby-clothes: the likeness is perfectly horrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The only visitor who made no secret of this impression was Jacqueline, who
      came to see her cousin as soon as she was permitted&mdash;that is, as soon
      as her friend was able to sit up and be prettily dressed, as became the
      mother of such a little gentleman as the heir of all the Talbruns. When
      Jacqueline saw the little creature half-smothered in the lace that trimmed
      his pillows, she burst out laughing, though it was in the presence of his
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mon Dieu!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;how ugly! I never should have supposed we
      could have been as ugly as that! Why, his face is all the colors of the
      rainbow; who would have imagined it? And he crumples up his little face
      like those things in gutta-percha. My poor Giselle, how can you bear to
      show him! I never, never could covet a baby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giselle, in consternation, asked herself whether this strange girl, who
      did not care for children, could be a proper wife for Fred; but her
      habitual indulgence came to her aid, and she thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is but a child herself, she does not know what she is saying,&rdquo; and
      profiting by her first tete-a-tete with Jacqueline&rsquo;s stepmother, she spoke
      as she had promised to Madame de Nailles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A matchmaker already!&rdquo; said the Baroness, with a smile. &ldquo;And so soon
      after you have found out what it costs to be a mother! How good of you, my
      dear Giselle! So you support Fred as a candidate? But I can&rsquo;t say I think
      he has much chance; Monsieur de Nailles has his own ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke as if she really thought that M. de Nailles could have any ideas
      but her own. When the adroit Clotilde was at a loss, she was likely to
      evoke this chimerical notion of her husband&rsquo;s having an opinion of his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Madame, you can do anything you like with him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clever woman sighed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you fancy that when people have been long married a wife retains as
      much influence over her husband as you have kept over Monsieur de Talbrun?
      You will learn to know better, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have no influence,&rdquo; murmured Giselle, who knew herself to be her
      husband&rsquo;s slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I know better. You are making believe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but we were not talking about me, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes. I understood. I will think about it. I will try to bring over
      Monsieur de Nailles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was not at all disposed to drop the meat for the sake of the shadow,
      but she was not sure of M. de Cymier, notwithstanding all that Madame de
      Villegry was at pains to tell her about his serious intentions. On the
      other hand, she would have been far from willing to break with a man so
      brilliant, who made himself so agreeable at her Tuesday receptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meantime, it would be well if you, dear, were to try to find out what
      Jacqueline thinks. You may not find it very easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you authorize me to tell her how well he loves her? Oh, then, I am
      quite satisfied!&rdquo; cried Giselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was under a mistake. Jacqueline, as soon as she began to speak to
      her of Fred&rsquo;s suit, stopped her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow! Why can&rsquo;t he amuse himself for some time longer and let me
      do the same? Men seem to me so strange! Now, Fred is one who, just because
      he is good and serious by nature, fancies that everybody else should be
      the same; he wishes me to be tethered in the flowery meads of Lizerolles,
      and browse where he would place me. Such a life would be an end of
      everything&mdash;an end to my life, and I should not like it at all. I
      should prefer to grow old in Paris, or some other capital, if my husband
      happened to be engaged in diplomacy. Even supposing I marry&mdash;which I
      do not think an absolute necessity, unless I can not get rid otherwise of
      an inconvenient chaperon&mdash;and to do my stepmother justice, she knows
      well enough that I will not submit to too much of her dictation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacqueline, they say you see too much of the Odinskas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! that&rsquo;s another fault you find in me. I go there because Madame
      Strahlberg is so kind as to give me some singing-lessons. If you only knew
      how much progress I am making, thanks to her. Music is a thousand times
      more interesting, I can tell you, than all that you can do as mistress of
      a household. You don&rsquo;t think so? Oh! I know Enguerrand&rsquo;s first tooth, his
      first steps, his first gleams of intelligence, and all that. Such things
      are not in my line, you know. Of course I think your boy very funny, very
      cunning, very&mdash;anything you like to fancy him, but forgive me if I am
      glad he does not belong to me. There, don&rsquo;t you see now that marriage is
      not my vocation, so please give up speaking to me about matrimony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you will,&rdquo; said Giselle, sadly, &ldquo;but you will give great pain to a
      good man whose heart is wholly yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not ask for his heart. Such gifts are exasperating. One does not
      know what to do with them. Can&rsquo;t he&mdash;poor Fred&mdash;love me as I
      love him, and leave me my liberty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your liberty!&rdquo; exclaimed Giselle; &ldquo;liberty to ruin your life, that&rsquo;s what
      it will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, one would suppose there was only one kind of existence in your
      eyes&mdash;this life of your own, Giselle. To leave one cage to be shut up
      in another&mdash;that is the fate of many birds, I know, but there are
      others who like to use their wings to soar into the air. I like that
      expression. Come, little mother, tell me right out, plainly, that your lot
      is the only one in this world that ought to be envied by a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giselle answered with a strange smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem astonished that I adore my baby; but since he came great things
      seem to have been revealed to me. When I hold him to my breast I seem to
      understand, as I never did before, duty and marriage, family ties and
      sorrows, life itself, in short, its griefs and joys. You can not
      understand that now, but you will some day. You, too, will gaze upon the
      horizon as I do. I am ready to suffer; I am ready for self-sacrifice. I
      know now whither my life leads me. I am led, as it were, by this little
      being, who seemed to me at first only a doll, for whom I was embroidering
      caps and dresses. You ask whether I am satisfied with my lot in life. Yes,
      I am, thanks to this guide, this guardian angel, thanks to my precious
      Enguerrand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline listened, stupefied, to this unexpected outburst, so unlike her
      cousin&rsquo;s usual language; but the charm was broken by its ending with the
      tremendously long name of Enguerrand, which always made her laugh, it was
      in such perfect harmony with the feudal pretensions of the Monredons and
      the Talbruns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How solemn and eloquent and obscure you are, my dear,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You
      speak like a sibyl. But one thing I see, and that is that you are not so
      perfectly happy as you would have us believe, seeing that you feel the
      need of consolations. Then, why do you wish me to follow your example?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fred is not Monsieur de Talbrun,&rdquo; said the young wife, for the moment
      forgetting herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant nothing, except that if you married Fred you would have had the
      advantage of first knowing him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s your fixed idea. But I am getting to know Monsieur de Cymier
      pretty well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have betrayed yourself,&rdquo; cried Giselle, with indignation. &ldquo;Monsieur
      de Cymier!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Cymier is coming to our house on Saturday evening, and I must
      get up a Spanish song that Madame Strahlberg has taught me, to charm his
      ears and those of other people. Oh! I can do it very well. Won&rsquo;t you come
      and hear me play the castanets, if Monsieur Enguerrand can spare you?
      There is a young Polish pianist who is to play our accompaniment. Ah,
      there is nothing like a Polish pianist to play Chopin! He is charming,
      poor young man! an exile, and in poverty; but he is cared for by those
      ladies, who take him everywhere. That is the sort of life I should like&mdash;the
      life of Madame Strahlberg&mdash;to be a young widow, free to do what I
      pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may be a widow&mdash;but some say she is divorced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! is it you who repeat such naughty scandals, Giselle? Where shall
      charity take refuge in this world if not in your heart? I am going&mdash;your
      seriousness may be catching. Kiss me before I go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Madame de Talbrun, turning her head away.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this she asked herself whether she ought not to discourage Fred. She
      could not resolve on doing so, yet she could not tell him what was false;
      but by eluding the truth with that ability which kind-hearted women can
      always show when they try to avoid inflicting pain, she succeeded in
      leaving the young man hope enough to stimulate his ambition.

      CHAPTER XI. FRED ASKS A QUESTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Time, whatever may be said of it by the calendars, is not to be measured
      by days, weeks, and months in all cases; expectation, hope, happiness and
      grief have very different ways of counting hours, and we know from our own
      experience that some are as short as a minute, and others as long as a
      century. The love or the suffering of those who can tell just how long
      they have suffered, or just how long they have been in love, is only
      moderate and reasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame d&rsquo;Argy found the two lonely years she passed awaiting the return of
      her son, who was winning his promotion to the rank of ensign, so long,
      that it seemed to her as if they never would come to an end. She had given
      a reluctant consent to his notion of adopting the navy as a profession,
      thinking that perhaps, after all, there might be no harm in allowing her
      dear boy to pass the most dangerous period of his youth under strict
      discipline, but she could not be patient forever! She idolized her son too
      much to be resigned to living without him; she felt that he was hers no
      longer. Either he was at sea or at Toulon, where she could very rarely
      join him, being detained at Lizerolles by the necessity of looking after
      their property. With what eagerness she awaited his promotion, which she
      did not doubt was all the Nailles waited for to give their consent to the
      marriage; of their happy half-consent she hastened to remind them in a
      note which announced the new grade to which he had been promoted. Her
      indignation was great on finding that her formal request received no
      decided answer; but, as her first object was Fred&rsquo;s happiness, she placed
      the reply she had received in its most favorable light when she forwarded
      it to the person whom it most concerned. She did this in all honesty. She
      was not willing to admit that she was being put off with excuses; still
      less could she believe in a refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      She accepted the excuse that M. de Nailles gave for returning no decided
      answer, viz.: that &ldquo;Jacqueline was too young,&rdquo; though she answered him
      with some vehemence: &ldquo;Fred was born when I was eighteen.&rdquo; But she had to
      accept it. Her ensign would have to pass a few more months on the coast of
      Senegal, a few more months which were made shorter by the encouragement
      forwarded to him by his mother, who was careful to send him everything she
      could find out that seemed to be, or that she imagined might be, in his
      favor; she underlined such things and commented upon them, so as to make
      the faintest hypothesis seem a certainty. Sometimes she did not even wait
      for the post. Fred would find, on putting in at some post, a cablegram:
      &ldquo;Good news,&rdquo; or &ldquo;All goes well,&rdquo; and he would be beside himself with joy
      and excitement until, on receiving his poor, dear mother&rsquo;s next letter, he
      found out on how slight a foundation her assurance had been founded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, she wrote him disagreeable things about Jacqueline, as if she
      would like to disenchant him, and then he said to himself: &ldquo;By this, I am
      to understand that my affairs are not going on well; I still count for
      little, notwithstanding my promotion.&rdquo; Ah! if he could only have had, so
      near the beginning of his career, any opportunity of distinguishing
      himself! No brilliant deed would have been too hard for him. He would have
      scaled the very skies. Alas! he had had no chance to win distinction, he
      had only had to follow in the beaten track of ordinary duty; he had
      encountered no glorious perils, though at St. Louis he had come very near
      leaving his bones, but it was only a case of typhoid fever. This fever,
      however, brought about a scene between M. de Nailles and his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When,&rdquo; she cried, with all the fury of a lioness, &ldquo;do you expect to come
      to the conclusion that my son is a suitable match for Jacqueline? Do you
      imagine that I shall let him wait till he is a post-captain to satisfy the
      requirements of Mademoiselle your daughter&mdash;provided he does not die
      in a hospital? Do you think that I shall be willing to go on living&mdash;if
      you can call it living!&mdash;all alone and in continual apprehension? Why
      do you let him keep on in uncertainty? You know his worth, and you know
      that with him Jacqueline would be happy. Instead of that&mdash;instead of
      saying once for all to this young man, who is more in love with her than
      any other man will ever be: &lsquo;There, take her, I give her to you,&rsquo; which
      would be the straightforward, sensible way, you go on encouraging the
      caprices of a child who will end by wasting, in the life you are
      permitting her to lead, all the good qualities she has and keeping nothing
      but the bad ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu! I can&rsquo;t see that Jacqueline leads a life like that!&rdquo; said M. de
      Nailles, who felt that he must say something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see, you don&rsquo;t see! How can any one see who won&rsquo;t open his
      eyes? My poor friend, just look for once at what is going on around you,
      under your own roof&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacqueline is devoted to music,&rdquo; said her father, good-humoredly. Madame
      d&rsquo;Argy in her heart thought he was losing his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in truth he was growing older day by day, becoming more and more
      anxious, more and more absorbed in the great struggle&mdash;not for life;
      that might exhaust a man, but at least it was energetic and noble&mdash;but
      for superfluous wealth, for vanity, for luxury, which, for his own part,
      he cared nothing for, and which he purchased dearly, spurred on to
      exertion by those near to him, who insisted on extravagances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, Jacqueline, I know, is devoted to music,&rdquo; went on Madame d&rsquo;Argy,
      with an air of extreme disapproval, &ldquo;too much so! And when she is able to
      sing like Madame Strahlberg, what good will it do her? Even now I see more
      than one little thing about her that needs to be reformed. How can she
      escape spoiling in that crowd of Slavs and Yankees, people of no position
      probably in their own countries, with whom you permit her to associate?
      People nowadays are so imprudent about acquaintances! To be a foreigner is
      a passport into society. Just think what her poor mother would have said
      to the bad manners she is adopting from all parts of the globe? My poor,
      dear Adelaide! She was a genuine Frenchwoman of the old type; there are
      not many such left now. Ah!&rdquo; continued Madame d&rsquo;Argy, without any apparent
      connection with her subject, &ldquo;Monsieur de Talbrun&rsquo;s mother, if he had one,
      would be truly happy to see him married to Giselle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; faltered M. de Nailles, struck by the truth of some of these
      remarks, &ldquo;I make no opposition&mdash;quite the contrary&mdash;I have
      spoken several times about your son, but I was not listened to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can she say against Fred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. She is very fond of him, that you know as well as I do. But
      those childish attachments do not necessarily lead to love and marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friendship on her side might be enough,&rdquo; said Madame d&rsquo;Argy, in the tone
      of a woman who had never known more than that in marriage. &ldquo;My poor Fred
      has enthusiasm and all that, enough for two. And in time she will be madly
      in love with him&mdash;she must! It is impossible it should be otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, persuade her yourself if you can; but Jacqueline has a pretty
      strong will of her own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline&rsquo;s will was a reality, though the ideas of M. de Nailles may
      have been illusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my wife, too!&rdquo; resumed the Baron, after a long sigh. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
      how it is, but Jacqueline, as she has grown up, has become like an
      unbroken colt, and those two, who were once all in all to each other, are
      now seldom of one mind. How am I to act when their two wills cross mine,
      as they often do? I have so many things on my mind. There are times when&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, one can see that. You don&rsquo;t seem to know where you are. And do you
      think that the disposition she shows to act, as you say, like an unbroken
      colt, is nothing to me? Do you think I am quite satisfied with my son&rsquo;s
      choice? I could have wished that he had chosen for his wife&mdash;but what
      is the use of saying what I wished? The important thing is that he should
      be happy in his own way. Besides, I dare say the young thing will calm
      down of her own accord. Her mother&rsquo;s daughter must be good at heart. All
      will come right when she is removed from a circle which is doing her no
      good; it is injuring her in people&rsquo;s opinion already, you must know. And
      how will it be by-and-bye? I hear people saying everywhere: &lsquo;How can the
      Nailles let that young girl associate so much with foreigners?&rsquo; You say
      they are old school-fellows, they went to the &lsquo;cours&rsquo; together. But see if
      Madame d&rsquo;Etaples and Madame Ray, under the same pretext, let Isabelle and
      Yvonne associate with the Odinskas! As to that foolish woman, Madame
      d&rsquo;Avrigny, she goes to their house to look up recruits for her operettas,
      and Madame Strahlberg has one advantage over regular artists, there is no
      call to pay her. That is the reason why she invites her. Besides which,
      she won&rsquo;t find it so easy to marry Dolly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! there are several reasons for that,&rdquo; said the Baron, who could see
      the mote in his neighbor&rsquo;s eye, &ldquo;Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Avrigny has led a life so
      very worldly ever since she was a child, so madly fast and lively, that
      suitors are afraid of her. Jacqueline, thank heaven, has never yet been in
      what is called the world. She only visits those with whom she is on terms
      of intimacy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An intimacy which includes all Paris,&rdquo; said Madame d&rsquo;Argy, raising her
      eyes to heaven. &ldquo;If she does not go to great balls, it is only because her
      stepmother is bored by them. But with that exception it seems to me she is
      allowed to do anything. I don&rsquo;t see the difference. But, to be sure, if
      Jacqueline is not for us, you have a right to say that I am interfering in
      what does not concern me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said the unfortunate father, &ldquo;I feel how much I ought to
      value your advice, and an alliance with your family would please me more
      than anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said the truth, for he was disturbed by seeing M. de Cymier so slow in
      making his proposals, and he was also aware that young girls in our day
      are less sought for in marriage than they used to be. His friend Wermant,
      rich as he was, had had some trouble in capturing for Berthe a fellow of
      no account in the Faubourg St. Germain, and the prize was not much to be
      envied. He was a young man without brains and without a sou, who enjoyed
      so little consideration among his own people that his wife had not been
      received as she expected, and no one spoke of Madame de Belvan without
      adding: &ldquo;You know, that little Wermant, daughter of the &lsquo;agent de
      change&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course, Jacqueline had the advantage of good birth over Berthe, but how
      great was her inferiority in point of fortune! M. de Nailles sometimes
      confided these perplexities to his wife, without, however, receiving much
      comfort from her. Nor did the Baroness confess to her husband all her own
      fears. In secret she often asked herself, with the keen insight of a woman
      of the world well trained in artifice and who possessed a thorough
      knowledge of mankind, whether there might not be women capable of using a
      young girl so as to put the world on a wrong scent; whether, in other
      words, Madame de Villegry did not talk everywhere about M. de Cymier&rsquo;s
      attentions to Mademoiselle de Nailles in order to conceal his relations to
      herself? Madame de Villegry indeed cared little about standing well in
      public opinion, but rather the contrary; she would not, however, for the
      world have been willing, by too openly favoring one man among her
      admirers, to run the risk of putting the rest to flight. No doubt M. de
      Cymier was most assiduous in his attendance on the receptions and dances
      at Madame de Nailles&rsquo;s, but he was there always at the same time as Madame
      de Villegry herself. They would hold whispered conferences in corners,
      which might possibly have been about Jacqueline, but there was no proof
      that they were so, except what Madame de Villegry herself said. &ldquo;At any
      rate,&rdquo; thought Madame de Nailles, &ldquo;if Fred comes forward as a suitor it
      may stimulate Monsieur de Cymier. There are men who put off taking a
      decisive step till the last moment, and are only to be spurred up by
      competition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So every opportunity was given to Fred to talk freely with Jacqueline when
      he returned to Paris. By this time he wore two gold-lace stripes upon his
      sleeve. But Jacqueline avoided any tete-a-tete with him as if she
      understood the danger that awaited her. She gave him no chance of speaking
      alone with her. She was friendly&mdash;nay, sometimes affectionate when
      other people were near them, but more commonly she teased him, bewildered
      him, excited him. After an hour or two spent in her society he would go
      home sometimes savage, sometimes desponding, to ponder in his own room,
      and in his own heart, what interpretation he ought to put upon the things
      that she had said to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more he thought, the less he understood. He would not have confided in
      his mother for the world; she might have cast blame on Jacqueline. Besides
      her, he had no one who could receive his confidences, who would bear with
      his perplexities, who could assist in delivering him from the network of
      hopes and fears in which, after every interview with Jacqueline, he seemed
      to himself to become more and more entangled.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, however, at one of the soirees given every fortnight by Madame de
      Nailles, he succeeded in gaining her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me this quadrille,&rdquo; he said to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, as she could not well refuse, he added, as soon as she had taken his
      arm: &ldquo;We will not dance, and I defy you to escape me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is treason!&rdquo; she cried, somewhat angrily. &ldquo;We are not here to talk;
      I can almost guess beforehand what you have to say, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he had made her sit down in the recess of that bow-window which had
      been called the young girls&rsquo; corner years ago. He stood before her,
      preventing her escape, and half-laughing, though he was deeply moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you have guessed what I wanted to say, answer me quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must I? Must I, really? Why didn&rsquo;t you ask my father to do your
      commission? It is so horribly disagreeable to do these things for one&rsquo;s
      self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends upon what the things may be that have to be said. I should
      think it ought to be very agreeable to pronounce the word on which the
      happiness of a whole life is to depend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what a grand phrase! As if I could be essential to anybody&rsquo;s
      happiness? You can&rsquo;t make me believe that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken. You are indispensable to mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! my declaration has been made,&rdquo; thought Fred, much relieved that it
      was over, for he had been afraid to pronounce the decisive words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I thought that were true, I should be very sorry,&rdquo; said
      Jacqueline, no longer smiling, but looking down fixedly at the pointed toe
      of her little slipper; &ldquo;because&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped suddenly. Her face flushed red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to explain to you;&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain nothing,&rdquo; pleaded Fred; &ldquo;all I ask is Yes, nothing more. There is
      nothing else I care for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her head coldly and haughtily, yet her voice trembled as she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will force me to say it? Then, no! No!&rdquo; she repeated, as if to
      reaffirm her refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, alarmed by Fred&rsquo;s silence, and above all by his looks, he who had
      seemed so gay shortly before and whose face now showed an anguish such as
      she had never yet seen on the face of man, she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, forgive me!&mdash;Forgive me,&rdquo; she repeated in a lower voice, holding
      out her hand. He did not take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love some one else?&rdquo; he asked, through his clenched teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened her fan and affected to examine attentively the pink landscape
      painted on it to match her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you think so? I wish to be free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free? Are you free? Is a woman ever free?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline shook her head, as if expressing vague dissent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free at least to see a little of the world,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to choose, to use
      my wings, in short&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she moved her slender arms with an audacious gesture which had nothing
      in common with the flight of that mystic dove upon which she had meditated
      when holding the card given her by Giselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free to prefer some other man,&rdquo; said Fred, who held fast to his idea with
      the tenacity of jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that is different. Supposing there were anyone whom I liked&mdash;not
      more, but differently from the way I like you&mdash;it is possible. But
      you spoke of loving!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your distinctions are too subtle,&rdquo; said Fred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, much as it seems to astonish you, I am quite capable of seeing
      the difference,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, with the look and the accent of a person
      who has had large experience. &ldquo;I have loved once&mdash;a long time ago, a
      very long time ago, a thousand years and more. Yes, I loved some one, as
      perhaps you love me, and I suffered more than you will ever suffer. It is
      ended; it is over&mdash;I think it is over forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How foolish! At your age!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that kind of love is ended for me. Others may please me, others do
      please me, as you said, but it is not the same thing. Would you like to
      see the man I once loved?&rdquo; asked Jacqueline, impelled by a juvenile desire
      to exhibit her experience, and also aware instinctively that to cast a
      scrap of past history to the curious sometimes turns off their attention
      on another track. &ldquo;He is near us now,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while Fred&rsquo;s angry eyes, under his frowning brows, were wandering all
      round the salon, she pointed to Hubert Marien with a movement of her fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marien was looking on at the dancing, with his old smile, not so brilliant
      now as it had been. He now only smiled at beauty collectively, which was
      well represented that evening in Madame de Nailles&rsquo;s salon. Young girls
      &lsquo;en masse&rsquo; continued to delight him, but his admiration as an artist
      became less and less personal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had grown stout, his hair and beard were getting gray; he was
      interested no longer in Savonarola, having obtained, thanks to his
      picture, the medal of honor, and the Institute some months since had
      opened its doors to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marien? You are laughing at me!&rdquo; cried Fred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is simply the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some magnetic influence at that moment caused the painter to turn his eyes
      toward the spot where they were talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were speaking of you,&rdquo; said Jacqueline.
    </p>
    <p>
      And her tone was so singular that he dared not ask what they were saying.
      With humility which had in it a certain touch of bitterness he said, still
      smiling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might find something better to do than to talk good or evil of a poor
      fellow who counts now for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Counts for nothing! A fellow to be pitied!&rdquo; cried Fred, &ldquo;a man who has
      just been elected to the Institute&mdash;you are hard to satisfy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline sat looking at him like a young sorceress engaged in sticking
      pins into the heart of a waxen figure of her enemy. She never missed an
      opportunity of showing her implacable dislike of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to Fred: &ldquo;What I was telling you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am quite
      willing to repeat in his presence. The thing has lost its importance now
      that he has become more indifferent to me than any other man in the
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, hoping that Marien had understood what she was saying and
      that he resented the humiliating avowal from her own lips that her
      childish love was now only a memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is the only confession you have to make to me,&rdquo; said Fred, who
      had almost recovered his composure, &ldquo;I can put up with my former rival,
      and I pass a sponge over all that has happened in your long past of
      seventeen years and a half, Jacqueline. Tell me only that at present you
      like no one better than me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled a half-smile, but he did not see it. She made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he here, too&mdash;like the other!&rdquo; he asked, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she saw his restless eyes turn for an instant to the conservatory,
      where Madame de Villegry, leaning back in her armchair, and Gerard de
      Cymier, on a low seat almost at her feet, were carrying on their platonic
      flirtation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you must not think of quarrelling with him,&rdquo; cried Jacqueline,
      frightened at the look Fred fastened on De Cymier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it would be of no use. I shall go out to Tonquin, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fred! You are not serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see whether I am not serious. At this very moment I know a man
      who will be glad to exchange with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! go and get yourself killed at Tonquin for a foolish little girl
      like me, who is very, very fond of you, but hardly knows her own mind. It
      would be absurd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People are not always killed at Tonquin, but I must have new interests,
      something to divert my mind from&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fred! my dear Fred&rdquo;&mdash;Jacqueline had suddenly become almost tender,
      almost suppliant. &ldquo;Your mother! Think of your mother! What would she say?
      Oh, my God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother must be allowed to think that I love my profession better than
      all else. But, Jacqueline,&rdquo; continued the poor fellow, clinging in despair
      to the very smallest hope, as a drowning man catches at a straw, &ldquo;if you
      do not, as you said, know exactly your own mind&mdash;if you would like to
      question your own heart&mdash;I would wait&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline was biting the end of her fan&mdash;a conflict was taking place
      within her breast. But to certain temperaments there is pleasure in
      breaking a chain or in leaping a barrier; she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fred, I am too much your friend to deceive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment M. de Cymier came toward them with his air of assurance:
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, you forget that you promised me this waltz,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I never forget anything,&rdquo; she answered, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred detained her an instant, saying, in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me. This moment, Jacqueline, is decisive. I must have an answer.
      I never shall speak to you again of my sorrow. But decide now&mdash;on the
      spot. Is all ended between us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not our old friendship, Fred,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, tears rising in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it, then, if you so will it. But our friendship never will show
      itself unless you are in need of friendship, and then only with the
      discretion that your present attitude toward me has imposed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ready, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Gerard, who, to allow them to end
      their conversation, had obligingly turned his attention to some madrigals
      that Colette Odinska was laughing over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline shook her head resolutely, though at that moment her heart felt
      as if it were in a vise, and the moisture in her eyes looked like anything
      but a refusal. Then, without giving herself time for further thought, she
      whirled away into the dance with M. de Cymier. It was over, she had flung
      to the winds her chance for happiness, and wounded a heart more cruelly
      than Hubert Marien had ever wounded hers. The most horrible thing in this
      unending warfare we call love is that we too often repay to those who love
      us the harm that has been done us by those whom we have loved. The seeds
      of mistrust and perversity sown by one man or by one woman bear fruit to
      be gathered by some one else.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. A COMEDY AND A TRAGEDY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The departure of Frederic d&rsquo;Argy for Tonquin occasioned a break in the
      intercourse between his mother and the family of De Nailles. The wails of
      Hecuba were nothing to the lamentations of poor Madame d&rsquo;Argy; the
      unreasonableness of her wrath and the exaggeration in her reproaches
      hindered even Jacqueline from feeling all the remorse she might otherwise
      have felt for her share in Fred&rsquo;s departure. She told her father, who the
      first time in her life addressed her with some severity, that she could
      not be expected to love all the young men who might threaten to go to the
      wars, or to fling themselves from fourth-story windows, for her sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very indelicate and inconsiderate of Fred to tell any one that it
      was my fault that he was doing anything so foolish,&rdquo; she said, with true
      feminine deceit, &ldquo;but he has taken the very worst possible means to make
      me care for him. Everybody has too much to say about this matter which
      concerns only him and me. Even Giselle thought proper to write me a
      sermon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she gave vent to her feelings in an exclamation of three syllables
      that she had learned from the Odinskas, which meant: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; (je
      m&rsquo;en moque).
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was not true. She cared very much for Giselle&rsquo;s good opinion, and
      for Madame d&rsquo;Argy&rsquo;s friendship. She suffered much in her secret heart at
      the thought of having given so much pain to Fred. She guessed how deep it
      was by the step to which it had driven him. But there was in her secret
      soul something more than all the rest, it was a puerile, but delicious
      satisfaction in feeling her own importance, in having been able to
      exercise an influence over one heart which might possibly extend to that
      of M. de Cymier. She thought he might be gratified by knowing that she had
      driven a young man to despair, if he guessed for whose sake she had been
      so cruel. He knew it, of course. Madame de Nailles took care that he
      should not be ignorant of it, and the pleasure he took in such a proof of
      his power over a young heart was not unlike that pleasure Jacqueline
      experienced in her coquetry&mdash;which crushed her better feelings. He
      felt proud of the sacrifice this beautiful girl had made for his sake,
      though he did not consider himself thereby committed to any decision, only
      he felt more attached to her than ever. Ever since the day when Madame de
      Villegry had first introduced him at the house of Madame de Nailles, he
      had had great pleasure in going there. The daughter of the house was more
      and more to his taste, but his liking for her was not such as to carry him
      beyond prudence. &ldquo;If I chose,&rdquo; he would say to himself after every time he
      met her, &ldquo;if I chose I could own that jewel. I have only to stretch out my
      hand and have it given me.&rdquo; And the next morning, after going to sleep
      full of that pleasant thought, he would awake glad to find that he was
      still as free as ever, and able to carry on a flirtation with a woman of
      the world, which imposed no obligations upon him, and yet at the same time
      make love to a young girl whom he would gladly have married but for
      certain reports which were beginning to circulate among men of business
      concerning the financial position of M. de Nailles.
    </p>
    <p>
      They said that he was withdrawing money from secure investments to repair
      (or to increase) considerable losses made by speculation, and that he
      operated recklessly on the Bourse. These rumors had already withdrawn
      Marcel d&rsquo;Etaples from the list of his daughter&rsquo;s suitors. The young fellow
      was a captain of Hussars, who had no scruple in declaring the reason of
      his giving up his interest in the young lady. Gerard de Cymier, more
      prudent, waited and watched, thinking it would be quite time enough to go
      to the bottom of things when he found himself called upon to make a
      decision, and greatly interested meantime in the daily increase of
      Jacqueline&rsquo;s beauty. It was evident she cared for him. After all, it was
      doing the little thing no harm to let her live on in the intoxication of
      vanity and hope, and to give her something to dwell upon in her innocent
      dreams. Never did Gerard allow himself to overstep the line he had marked
      out for himself; a glance, a slight pressure of the hand, which might have
      been intentional, or have meant nothing, a few ambiguous words in which an
      active imagination might find something to dream about, a certain way of
      passing his arm round her slight waist which would have meant much had it
      not been done in public to the sound of music, were all the proofs the
      young diplomatist had ever given of an attraction that was real so far as
      consisted with his complete selfishness, joined to his professional
      prudence, and that systematic habit of taking up fancies at any time for
      anything, which prevents each fancy as it occurs from ripening into
      passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He alluded indirectly to Fred&rsquo;s departure in a way that turned it into
      ridicule. While playing a game of &lsquo;boston&rsquo; he whispered into Jacqueline&rsquo;s
      ear something about the old-fashionedness and stupidity of Paul and
      Virginia, and his opinion of &ldquo;calf-love,&rdquo; as the English call an early
      attachment, and something about the right of every girl to know a suitor
      long before she consents to marry him. He said he thought that the days of
      courtship must be the most delightful in the life of a woman, and that a
      man who wished to cut them short was a fellow without delicacy or
      discretion!
    </p>
    <p>
      From this Jacqueline drew the conclusion that he was not willing to
      resemble such a fellow, and was more and more persuaded that there was
      tenderness in the way he pressed her waist, and that his voice had the
      softness of a caress when he spoke to her. He made many inquiries as to
      what she liked and what she wished for in the future, as if his great
      object in all things was to anticipate her wishes. As for his intimacy
      with Madame de Villegry, Jacqueline thought nothing of it, notwithstanding
      her habitual mistrust of those she called old women. In the first place,
      Madame de Villegry was her own mistress, nothing hindered them from having
      been married long ago had they wished it; besides, had not Madame de
      Villegry brought the young man to their house and let every one see, even
      Jacqueline herself, what was her object in doing so? In this matter she
      was their ally, a most zealous and kind ally, for she was continually
      advising her young friend as to what was most becoming to her and how she
      might make herself most attractive to men in general, with little covert
      allusions to the particular tastes of Gerard, which she said she knew as
      well as if he had been her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was lightly insinuated, but never insisted upon, with the tact
      which stood Madame de Villegry in stead of talent, and which had enabled
      her to perform some marvellous feats upon the tight-rope without losing
      her balance completely. She, too, made fun of the tragic determination of
      Fred, which all those who composed the society of the De Nailles had been
      made aware of by the indiscreet lamentations of Madame d&rsquo;Argy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not Jacqueline fortunate?&rdquo; cried. Colette Odinska, who, herself always
      on a high horse, looked on love in its tragic aspect, and would have liked
      to resemble Marie Stuart as much as she could, &ldquo;is she not fortunate? She
      has had a man who has gone abroad to get himself killed&mdash;and all for
      her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Colette imagined herself under the same circumstances, making the most of
      a slain lover, with a crape veil covering her fair hair, her mourning
      copied from that of her divorced sister, who wore her weeds so charmingly,
      but who was getting rather tired of a single life.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Miss Kate Sparks and Miss Nora, they could not understand why the
      breaking of half-a-dozen hearts should not be the prelude to every
      marriage. That, they said with much conviction, was always the case in
      America, and a girl was thought all the more of who had done so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline, however, thought more than was reasonable about the dangers
      that the friend of her childhood was going to encounter through her fault.
      Fred&rsquo;s departure would have lent him a certain prestige, had not a
      powerful new interest stepped in to divert her thoughts. Madame d&rsquo;Avrigny
      was getting up her annual private theatricals, and wanted Jacqueline to
      take the principal part in the play, saying that she ought to put her
      lessons in elocution to some use. The piece chosen was to illustrate a
      proverb, and was entirely new. It was as unexceptionable as it was
      amusing; the most severe critic could have found no fault with its
      morality or with its moral, which turned on the eagerness displayed by
      young girls nowadays to obtain diplomas. Scylla and Charybdis was its
      name. Its story was that of a young bride, who, thinking to please a
      husband, a stupid and ignorant man, was trying to obtain in secret a high
      place in the examination at the Sorbonne&mdash;&lsquo;un brevet superieur&rsquo;. The
      husband, disquieted by the mystery, is at first suspicious, then jealous,
      and then is overwhelmed with humiliation when he discovers that his wife
      knows more of everything than himself. He ends by imploring her to give up
      her higher education if she wishes to please him. The little play had all
      the modern loveliness and grace which Octave Feuillet alone can give, and
      it contained a lesson from which any one might profit; which was by no
      means always the case with Madame d&rsquo;Avrigny&rsquo;s plays, which too often were
      full of risky allusions, of critical situations, and the like; likely, in
      short, to &ldquo;sail too close to the wind,&rdquo; as Fred had once described them.
      But Madame d&rsquo;Avrigny&rsquo;s prime object was the amusement of society, and
      society finds pleasure in things which, if innocence understood them,
      would put her to the blush. This play, however, was an exception. There
      had been very little to cut out this time. Madame de Nailles had been
      asked to take the mother&rsquo;s part, but she declined, not caring to act such
      a character in a house where years before in all her glory she had made a
      sensation as a young coquette. So Madame d&rsquo;Avrigny had to take the part
      herself, not sorry to be able to superintend everything on the stage, and
      to prompt Dolly, if necessary&mdash;Dolly, who had but four words to say,
      which she always forgot, but who looked lovely in a little cap as a femme
      de chambre.
    </p>
    <p>
      People had been surprised that M. de Cymier should have asked for the part
      of the husband, a local magistrate, stiff and self-important, whom
      everybody laughed at. Jacqueline alone knew why he had chosen it: it would
      give him the opportunity of giving her two kisses. Of course those kisses
      were to be reserved for the representation, but whether intentionally or
      otherwise, the young husband ventured upon them at every rehearsal, in
      spite of the general outcry&mdash;not, however, very much in earnest, for
      it is well understood that in private theatricals certain liberties may be
      allowed, and M. de Cymier had never been remarkable for reserve when he
      acted at the clubs, where the female parts were taken by ladies from the
      smaller theatres. In this school he had acquired some reputation as an
      amateur actor. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; as he remarked on making his apology, &ldquo;we shall
      do it very awkwardly upon the stage if we are not allowed to practise it
      beforehand.&rdquo; Jacqueline burst out laughing, and did not make much show of
      opposition. To play the part of his wife, to hear him say to her, to
      respond with the affectionate and familiar &lsquo;toi&rsquo;, was so amusing! It was
      droll to see her cut out her husband in chemistry, history, and grammar,
      and make him confound La Fontaine with Corneille. She had such a little
      air while doing it! And at the close, when he said to her: &ldquo;If I give you
      a pony to-morrow, and a good hearty kiss this very minute, shall you be
      willing to give up getting that degree?&rdquo; she responded, with such gusto:
      &ldquo;Indeed, I shall!&rdquo; and her manner was so eager, so boyish, so full of fun,
      that she was wildly applauded, while Gerard embraced her as heartily as he
      liked, to make up to himself for her having had, as his wife, the upper
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this kissing threw him rather off his balance, and he might soon have
      sealed his fate, had not a very sad event occurred, which restored his
      self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dress rehearsal was to take place one bright spring day at about four
      o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. A large number of guests was assembled at the
      house of Madame d&rsquo;Avrigny. The performance had been much talked about
      beforehand in society. The beauty, the singing, and the histrionic powers
      of the principal actress had been everywhere extolled. Fully conscious of
      what was expected of her, and eager to do herself credit in every way,
      Jacqueline took advantage of Madame Strahlberg&rsquo;s presence to run over a
      little song, which she was to&mdash;sing between the acts and in which she
      could see no meaning whatever. This little song, which, to most of the
      ladies present, seemed simply idiotic, made the men in the audience cry
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; as if half-shocked, and then &ldquo;Encore! Encore!&rdquo; in a sort of frenzy.
      It was a so-called pastoral effusion, in which Colinette rhymed with
      herbette, and in which the false innocence of the eighteenth century was a
      cloak for much indelicate allusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never,&rdquo; said Jacqueline in self-defense, before she began the song,
      &ldquo;sang anything so stupid. And that is saying much when one thinks of all
      the nonsensical words that people set to music! It&rsquo;s a marvel how any one
      can like this stuff. Do tell me what there is in it?&rdquo; she added, turning
      to Gerard, who was charmed by her ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing beside the grand piano, with her arms waving as she sang,
      repeating, by the expression of her eyes, the question she had asked and
      to which she had received no answer, she was singing the verses she
      considered nonsense with as much point as if she had understood them,
      thanks to the hints given her by Madame Strahlberg, who was playing her
      accompaniment, when the entrance of a servant, who pronounced her name
      aloud, made a sudden interruption. &ldquo;Mademoiselle de Nailles is wanted at
      home at once. Modeste has come for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame d&rsquo;Avrigny went out to say to the old servant: &ldquo;She can not possibly
      go home with you! It is only half an hour since she came. The rehearsal is
      just beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But something Modeste said in answer made her give a little cry, full of
      consternation. She came quickly back, and going up to Jacqueline:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you must go home at once&mdash;there is bad news,
      your father is ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The solemnity of Madame d&rsquo;Avrigny&rsquo;s voice, the pity in her expression, the
      affection with which she spoke and above all her total indifference to the
      fate of her rehearsal, frightened Jacqueline. She rushed away, not waiting
      to say good-by, leaving behind her a general murmur of &ldquo;Poor thing!&rdquo; while
      Madame d&rsquo;Avrigny, recovering from her first shock, was already beginning
      to wonder&mdash;her instincts as an impresario coming once more to the
      front&mdash;whether the leading part might not be taken by Isabelle Ray.
      She would have to send out two hundred cards, at least, and put off her
      play for another fortnight. What a pity! It seemed as if misfortunes
      always happened just so as to interfere with pleasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fiacre which had brought Modeste was at the door. The old nurse helped
      her young lady into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened to papa?&rdquo; cried Jacqueline, impetuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something horrible in this sudden transition from gay excitement
      to the sharpest anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;that is to say&mdash;he is very sick. Don&rsquo;t tremble like
      that, my darling-courage!&rdquo; stammered Modeste, who was frightened by her
      agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was taken sick, you say. Where? How happened it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his study. Pierre had just brought him his letters. We thought we
      heard a noise as if a chair had been thrown down, and a sort of cry. I ran
      in to see. He was lying at full length on the floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now? How is he now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did what we could for him. Madame came back. He is lying on his bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Modeste covered her face with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not told me all. What else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu! you knew your poor father had heart disease. The last time the
      doctor saw him he thought his legs had swelled&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had!&rdquo; Jacqueline heard only that one word. It meant that the life of her
      father was a thing of the past. Hardly waiting till the fiacre could be
      stopped, she sprang out, rushed into the house, opened the door of her
      father&rsquo;s chamber, pushing aside a servant who tried to stop her, and fell
      upon her knees beside the bed where lay the body of her father, white and
      rigid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa! My poor dear&mdash;dear papa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hand she pressed to her lips was as cold as ice. She raised her
      frightened eyes to the face over which the great change from life to death
      had passed. &ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; Jacqueline had never looked on death
      before, but she knew this was not sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, speak to me, papa! It is I&mdash;it is Jacqueline!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her stepmother tried to raise her&mdash;tried to fold her in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me alone!&rdquo; she cried with horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to her as if her father, where he was now, so far from her, so
      far from everything, might have the power to look into human hearts, and
      know the perfidy he had known nothing of when he was living. He might see
      in her own heart, too, her great despair. All else seemed small and of no
      consequence when death was present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! why had she not been a better daughter, more loving, more devoted? why
      had she ever cared for anything but to make him happy?
    </p>
    <p>
      She sobbed aloud, while Madame de Nailles, pressing her handkerchief to
      her eyes, stood at the foot of the bed, and the doctor, too, was near,
      whispering to some one whom Jacqueline at first had not perceived&mdash;the
      friend of the family, Hubert Marien.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marien there? Was it not natural that, so intimate as he had always been
      with the dead man, he should have hastened to offer his services to the
      widow?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline flung herself upon her father&rsquo;s corpse, as if to protect it
      from profanation. She had an impulse to bear it away with her to some
      desert spot where she alone could have wept over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay thus a long time, beside herself with grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flowers which covered the bed and lay scattered on the floor, gave a
      festal appearance to the death-chamber. They had been purchased for a
      fete, but circumstances had changed their destination. That evening there
      was to have been a reception in the house of M. de Nailles, but the
      unexpected guest that comes without an invitation had arrived before the
      music and the dancers.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. THE STORM BREAKS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Monsieur de Nailles was dead, struck down suddenly by what is called
      indefinitely heart-failure. The trouble in that organ from which he had
      long suffered had brought on what might have been long foreseen, and yet
      every one seemed, stupefied by the event. It came upon them like a
      thunderbolt. It often happens so when people who are really ill persist in
      doing all that may be done with safety by other persons. They persuaded
      themselves, and those about them are easily persuaded, that small remedies
      will prolong indefinitely a state of things which is precarious to the
      last degree. Friends are ready to believe, when the sufferer complains
      that his work is too hard for him, that he thinks too much of his ailments
      and that he exaggerates trifles to which they are well accustomed, but
      which are best known to him alone. When M. de Nailles, several weeks
      before his death, had asked to be excused and to stay at home instead of
      attending some large gathering, his wife, and even Jacqueline, would try
      to convince him that a little amusement would be good for him; they were
      unwilling to leave him to the repose he needed, prescribed for him by the
      doctors, who had been unanimous that he must &ldquo;put down the brakes,&rdquo; give
      less attention to business, avoid late hours and over-exertion of all
      kinds. &ldquo;And, above all,&rdquo; said one of the lights of science whom he had
      consulted recently about certain feelings of faintness which were a bad
      symptom, &ldquo;above all, you must keep yourself from mental anxiety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How could he, when his fortune, already much impaired, hung on chances as
      uncertain as those in a game of roulette? What nonsense! The failure of a
      great financial company had brought about a crisis on the Bourse. The news
      of the inability of Wermant, the &lsquo;agent de change&rsquo;, to meet his
      engagements, had completed the downfall of M. de Nailles. Not only death,
      but ruin, had entered that house, where, a few hours before, luxury and
      opulence had seemed to reign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know whether there will be anything left for us to live upon,&rdquo;
       cried Madame de Nailles, with anguish, even while her husband&rsquo;s body lay
      in the chamber of death, and Jacqueline, kneeling beside it, wept,
      unwilling to receive comfort or consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned angrily upon her stepmother and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What matter? I have no father&mdash;there is nothing else I care for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But from that moment a dreadful thought, a thought she was ashamed of,
      which made her feel a monster of selfishness, rose in her mind, do what
      she would to hinder it. Jacqueline was sensible that she cared for
      something else; great as was her sense of loss, a sort of reckless
      curiosity seemed haunting her, while all the time she felt that her great
      grief ought not to give place to anything besides. &ldquo;How would Gerard de
      Cymier behave in these circumstances?&rdquo; She thought about it all one
      dreadful night as she and Modeste, who was telling her beads softly, sat
      in the faint light of the death-chamber. She thought of it at dawn, when,
      after one of those brief sleeps which come to the young under all
      conditions, she resumed with a sigh a sense of surrounding realities.
      Almost in the same instant she thought: &ldquo;My dear father will never wake
      again,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Does he love me?&mdash;does he now wish me to be his wife?&mdash;will
      he take me away?&rdquo; The devil, which put this thought into her heart, made
      her eager to know the answer to these questions. He suggested how dreadful
      life with her stepmother would be if no means of escape were offered her.
      He made her foresee that her stepmother would marry again&mdash;would
      marry Marien. &ldquo;But I shall not be there!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I will not
      countenance such an infamy!&rdquo; Oh, how she hoped Gerard de Cymier loved her!
      The hypocritical tears of Madame de Nailles disgusted her. She could not
      bear to have such false grief associated with her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men in black, with solemn faces, came and bore away the body, no longer
      like the form of the father she had loved. He had gone from her forever.
      Pompous funeral rites, little in accordance with the crash that soon
      succeeded them, were superintended by Marien, who, in the absence of near
      relatives, took charge of everything. He seemed to be deeply affected, and
      behaved with all possible kindness and consideration to Jacqueline, who
      could not, however, bring herself to thank him, or even to look at him.
      She hated him with an increase of resentment, as if the soul of her dead
      father, who now knew the truth, had passed into her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, M. de Cymier took care to inform himself of the state of things.
      It was easy enough to do so. All Paris was talking of the shipwreck in
      which life and fortune had been lost by a man whose kindliness as a host
      at his wife&rsquo;s parties every one had appreciated. That was what came,
      people said, of striving after big dividends! The house was to be sold,
      with the horses, the pictures, and the furniture. What a change for his
      poor wife and daughter! There were others who suffered by the Wermant
      crash, but those were less interesting than the De Nailles. M. de Belvan
      found himself left by his father-in-law&rsquo;s failure with a wife on his hands
      who not only had not a sou, but who was the daughter of an &lsquo;agent de
      change&rsquo; who had behaved dishonorably.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a text for dissertations on the disgrace of marrying for money;
      those who had done the same thing, minus the same consequences, being
      loudest in reprobating alliances of that kind. M. de Cymier listened
      attentively to such talk, looking and saying the right things, and as he
      heard more and more about the deplorable condition of M. de Nailles&rsquo;s
      affairs, he congratulated himself that a prudent presentiment had kept him
      from asking the hand of Jacqueline. He had had vague doubts as to the firm
      foundation of the opulence which made so charming a frame for her young
      beauty; it seemed to him as if she were now less beautiful than he had
      imagined her; the enchantment she had exercised upon him was thrown off by
      simple considerations of good sense. And yet he gave a long sigh of regret
      when he thought she was unattainable except by marriage. He, however,
      thanked heaven that he had not gone far enough to have compromised himself
      with her. The most his conscience could reproach him with was an
      occasional imprudence in moments of forgetfulness; no court of honor could
      hold him bound to declare himself her suitor. The evening that he made up
      his mind to this he wrote two letters, very nearly alike; one was to
      Madame d&rsquo;Avrigny, the other to Madame de Nailles, announcing that, having
      received orders to join the Embassy to which he was attached at Vienna, he
      was about to depart at once, with great regret that he should not be able
      to take leave of any one. To Madame d&rsquo;Avrigny he made apologies for having
      to give up his part in her theatricals; he entreated Madame de Nailles to
      accept both for herself and for Mademoiselle Jacqueline his deepest
      condolences and the assurance of his sympathy. The manner in which this
      was said was all it ought to have been, except that it might have been
      rather more brief. M. de Cymier said more than was necessary about his
      participation in their grief, because he was conscious of a total lack of
      sympathy. He begged the ladies would forgive him if, from feelings of
      delicacy and a sense of the respect due to a great sorrow, he did not,
      before leaving Paris, which he was about do to probably for a long time,
      personally present to them &lsquo;ses hommages attristes&rsquo;. Then followed a few
      lines in which he spoke of the pleasant recollections he should always
      retain of the hospitality he had enjoyed under M. de Nailles&rsquo;s roof, in a
      way that gave them clearly to understand that he had no expectation of
      ever entering their family on a more intimate footing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Nailles received this letter just as she had had a conversation
      with a man of business, who had shown her how complete was the ruin for
      which in a great measure she herself was responsible. She had no longer
      any illusions as to her position. When the estate had been settled there
      would be nothing left but poverty, not only for herself, who, having
      brought her husband no dot, had no right to consider herself wronged by
      the bankruptcy, but for Jacqueline, whose fortune, derived from her
      mother, had suffered under her father&rsquo;s management (there are such men&mdash;unfaithful
      guardians of a child&rsquo;s property, but yet good fathers) in every way in
      which it was possible to evade the provisions of the Code intended to
      protect the rights of minor children. In the little salon so charmingly
      furnished, where never before had sorrow or sadness been discussed, Madame
      de Nailles poured out her complaints to her stepdaughter and insisted upon
      plans of strict economy, when M. de Cymier&rsquo;s letter was brought in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read!&rdquo; said the Baroness, handing the strange document to Jacqueline,
      after she had read it through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she leaned back in her chair with a gesture which signified: &ldquo;This is
      the last straw!&rdquo; and remained motionless, apparently overwhelmed, with her
      face covered by one hand, but furtively watching the face of the girl so
      cruelly forsaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      That face told nothing, for pride supplies some sufferers with necessary
      courage. Jacqueline sat for some time with her eyes fixed on the decisive
      adieu which swept away what might have been her secret hope. The paper did
      not tremble in her hand, a half-smile of contempt passed over her mouth.
      The answer to the restless question that had intruded itself upon her in
      the first moments of her grief was now before her. Its promptness, its
      polished brutality, had given her a shock, but not the pain she had
      expected. Perhaps her great grief&mdash;the real, the true, the grief
      death brings&mdash;recovered its place in her heart, and prevented her
      from feeling keenly any secondary emotion. Perhaps this man, who could pay
      court to her in her days of happiness and disappear when the first trouble
      came, seemed to her not worth caring for.
    </p>
    <p>
      She silently handed back the letter to her stepmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more than I expected,&rdquo; said the Baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; replied Jacqueline with complete indifference. She wished to
      give no opening to any expressions of sympathy on the part of Madame de
      Nailles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Madame d&rsquo;Avrigny,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;has bad luck; all her actors seem to
      be leaving her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This speech was the vain bravado of a young soldier going into action. The
      poor child betrayed herself to the experienced woman, trained either to
      detect or to practise artifice, and who found bitter amusement in watching
      the girl&rsquo;s assumed &lsquo;sang-froid&rsquo;. But the mask fell off at the first touch
      of genuine sympathy. When Giselle, forgetful of a certain coolness between
      them ever since Fred&rsquo;s departure, came to clasp her in her arms, she
      showed only her true self, a girl suffering all the bitterness of a cruel,
      humiliating desertion. Long talks ensued between the friends, in which
      Jacqueline poured into Giselle&rsquo;s ear her sad discoveries in the past, her
      sorrows and anxieties in the present, and her vague plans for the future.
      &ldquo;I must go away,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I must escape somewhere; I can not go on
      living with Madame de Nailles&mdash;I should go mad, I should be tempted
      every day to upbraid her with her conduct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giselle made no attempt to curb an excitement which she knew would resist
      all she could say to calm it. She feigned agreement, hoping thereby to
      increase her future influence, and advised her friend to seek in a convent
      the refuge that she needed. But she must do nothing rashly; she should
      only consider it a temporary retreat whose motive was a wish to remain for
      a while within reach of religious consolation. In that way she would give
      people nothing to talk about, and her step mother could not be offended.
      It was never of any use to get out of a difficulty by breaking all the
      glass windows with a great noise, and good resolutions are made firmer by
      being matured in quietness. Such were the lessons Giselle herself had been
      taught by the Benedictine nuns, who, however deficient they might be in
      the higher education of women, knew at least how to bring up young girls
      with a view to making them good wives. Giselle illustrated this day by day
      in her relations to a husband as disagreeable as a husband well could be,
      a man of small intelligence, who was not even faithful to her. But she did
      not cite herself as an example. She never talked about herself, or her own
      difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an angel of sense and goodness,&rdquo; sobbed Jacqueline. &ldquo;I will do
      whatever you wish me to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count upon me&mdash;count upon all your friends,&rdquo; said Madame de Talbrun,
      tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, enumerating the oldest and the truest of these friends, she
      unluckily named Madame d&rsquo;Argy. Jacqueline drew herself back at once:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for pity&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t mention them to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Already a comparison between Fred&rsquo;s faithful affection and Gerard de
      Cymier&rsquo;s desertion had come into her mind, but she had refused to
      entertain it, declaring resolutely to herself that she never should repent
      her refusal. She was sore, she was angry with all men, she wished all were
      like Cymier or like Marien, that she might hate every one of them; she
      came to the conclusion in her heart of hearts that all of them, even the
      best, if put to the proof, would turn out selfish. She liked to think so&mdash;to
      believe in none of them. Thus it happened that an unexpected visit from
      Fred&rsquo;s mother, among those that she received in her first days of
      orphanhood, was particularly agreeable to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame d&rsquo;Argy, on hearing of the death and of the ruin of M. de Nailles,
      was divided by two contradictory feelings. She clearly saw the hand of
      Providence in what had happened: her son was in the squadron on its way to
      attack Formosa; he was in peril from the climate, in peril from Chinese
      bullets, and assuredly those who had brought him into peril could not be
      punished too severely; on the other hand, the last mail from Tonquin had
      brought her one of those great joys which always incline us to be
      merciful. Fred had so greatly distinguished himself in a series of fights
      upon the river Min that he had been offered his choice between the Cross
      of the Legion of Honor or promotion. He told his mother now that he had
      quite recovered from a wound he had received which had brought him some
      glory, but which he assured her had done him no bodily harm, and he
      repeated to her what he would not tell her at first, some words of praise
      from Admiral Courbet of more value in his eyes than any reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Triumphant herself, and much moved by pity for Jacqueline, Madame d&rsquo;Argy
      felt as if she must put an end to a rupture which could not be kept up
      when a great sorrow had fallen on her old friends, besides which she
      longed to tell every one, those who had been blind and ungrateful in
      particular, that Fred had proved himself a hero. So Jacqueline and her
      stepmother saw her arrive as if nothing had ever come between them. There
      were kisses and tears, and a torrent of kindly meant questions,
      affectionate explanations, and offers of service. But Fred&rsquo;s mother could
      not help showing her own pride and happiness to those in sorrow. They
      congratulated her with sadness. Madame d&rsquo;Argy would have liked to think
      that the value of what she had lost was now made plain to Jacqueline. And
      if it caused her one more pang&mdash;what did it matter? He and his mother
      had suffered too. It was the turn of others. God was just. Resentment, and
      kindness, and a strange mixed feeling of forgiveness and revenge contended
      together in the really generous heart of Madame d&rsquo;Argy, but that heart was
      still sore within her. Pity, however, carried the day, and had it not been
      for the irritating coldness of &ldquo;that little hard-hearted thing,&rdquo; as she
      called Jacqueline, she would have entirely forgiven her. She never
      suspected that the exaggerated reserve of manner that offended her was
      owing to Jacqueline&rsquo;s dread (commendable in itself) of appearing to wish
      in her days of misfortune for the return of one she had rejected in the
      time of prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the received opinion that society abandons those who are
      overtaken by misfortune, all the friends of the De Nailles flocked to
      offer their condolences to the widow and the orphan with warm
      demonstrations of interest. Curiosity, a liking to witness, or to
      experience, emotion, the pleasure of being able to tell what has been seen
      and heard, to find out new facts and repeat them again to others, joined
      to a sort of vague, commonplace, almost intrusive pity, are sentiments,
      which sometimes in hours of great disaster, produce what appears to wear
      the look of sympathy. A fortnight after M. de Nailles&rsquo;s death, between the
      acts of Scylla and Charybdis, the principal parts in which were taken by
      young d&rsquo;Etaples and Isabelle Ray, the company, as it ate ices, was glibly
      discussing the real drama which had produced in their own elegant circle
      much of the effect a blow has upon an ant-hill&mdash;fear, agitation, and
      a tumultuous rush to the scene of the disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great indignation was expressed against the man who had risked the fortune
      of his family in speculation. Oh! the thing had been going on for a long
      while. His fortune had been gradually melting away; Grandchaux was loaded
      down with mortgages and would bring almost nothing at a forced sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody forgot that had M. de Nailles&rsquo;s speculations been successful
      they would have been called matters of business, conducted with great
      ability on a large scale. When a performer falls from the tightrope, who
      remembers all the times he has not failed? It is simply said that he fell
      from his own carelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor Baroness is touchingly resigned,&rdquo; said Madame de Villegry, with
      a deep sigh; &ldquo;and heaven knows how many other cares she has besides the
      loss of money! I don&rsquo;t mean only the death of her husband&mdash;and you
      know how much they were attached to each other&mdash;I am speaking of that
      unaccountable resolution of Jacqueline&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame d&rsquo;Avrigny here came forward with her usual equanimity which nothing
      disturbed, unless it were something which interfered with the success of
      her salon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was of course very sorry for her friends in trouble, but the
      vicissitudes that had happened to her theatricals she had more at heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the first act did not go off badly, did it? The
      musical part made up for the rest. That divine Strahlberg is ready for any
      emergency. How well she sang that air of &lsquo;La Petite Mariee!&rsquo; It was
      exquisite, but I regretted Jacqueline. She was so charming in that lively
      little part. What a catastrophe!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a terrible catastrophe! Were you speaking of the retreat she wishes
      to make in a convent? Well, I quite understand how she feels about it! I
      should feel the same myself. In the bewilderment of a first grief one does
      not care to see anything of the world. &lsquo;Mon Dieu&rsquo;! youth always has these
      exaggerated notions. She will come back to us. Poor little thing! Of
      course it was no fault of hers, and I should not think of blaming Monsieur
      de Cymier. The exigencies of his career&mdash;but you all must own that
      unexpected things happen so suddenly in this life that it is enough to
      discourage any one who likes to open her house and provide amusement for
      her friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every one present pitied her for the contretemps over which she had
      triumphed so successfully. Then she resumed, serenely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that Isabelle played the part almost as well as
      Jacqueline? Up to the last moment I was afraid that something would go
      wrong. When one gets into a streak of ill-luck&mdash;but all went off to
      perfection, thank heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Madame Odinska was whispering to one of those who sat near her
      her belief that Jacqueline would never get over her father&rsquo;s loss. &ldquo;It
      would not astonish me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to hear that the child, who has a noble
      nature, would remain in the convent and take the veil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Any kind of heroic deed seemed natural to this foolish enthusiast, who, as
      a matter of fact, in her own life, had never shown any tendency to heroic
      virtues; her mission in life had seemed to be to spoil her daughters in
      every possible way, and to fling away more money than belonged to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? Was she so very fond of her father!&rdquo; asked Madame Ray,
      incredulously. &ldquo;When he was alive, they did not seem to make much of him
      in his own house. Maybe this retreat is a good way of getting over a
      little wound to her &lsquo;amour-propre&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The proper thing, I think,&rdquo; said Madame d&rsquo;Etaples, &ldquo;would be for the
      mother and daughter to keep together, to bear the troubles before them
      hand in hand. Jacqueline does not seem to think much of the last wishes of
      the father she pretends to be so fond of. The Baroness showed me, with
      many tears, a letter he left joined to his will, which was written some
      years ago, and which now, of course, is of no value. He told mother and
      daughter to take care of each other and hoped they would always remain
      friends, loving each other for love of him. Jacqueline&rsquo;s conduct amazes
      me; it looks like ingratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! she is a hard-hearted little thing! I always thought so!&rdquo; said Madame
      de Villegry, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the rising of the curtain stopped short these discussions, which
      displayed so much good-nature and perspicacity. But some laid the blame on
      the influence of that little bigot of a Talbrun, who had secretly blown up
      the fire of religious enthusiasm in Jacqueline, when Madame d&rsquo;Avrigny&rsquo;s
      energetic &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; put an end to the discussion. It was time to come back
      to more immediate interests, to the play which went on in spite of wind
      and tide.

      CHAPTER XIV. BITTER DISILLUSION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some people in this world who turn round and round in a daily circle of
      small things, like squirrels in a cage, have no idea of the pleasure a
      young creature, conscious of courage, has in trying its strength; this
      struggle with fortune loses its charm as it grows longer and longer and
      more and more difficult, but at the beginning it is an almost certain
      remedy for sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her resolve to make head against misfortune Jacqueline owed the fact
      that she did not fall into those morbid reveries which might have
      converted her passing fancy for a man who was simply a male flirt into the
      importance of a lost love. Is there any human being conscious of energy,
      and with faith in his or her own powers, who has not wished to know
      something of adversity in order to rise to the occasion and confront it?
      To say nothing of the pleasure there is in eating brown bread, when one
      has been fed only on cake, or of the satisfaction that a child feels when,
      after strict discipline, he is left to do as he likes, to say nothing of
      the pleasure ladies boarding in nunneries are sure to feel on reentering
      the world, at recovering their liberty, Jacqueline by nature loved
      independence, and she was attracted by the novelty of her situation as
      larks are attracted by a mirror. She was curious to know what life held
      for her in reserve, and she was extremely anxious to repair the error she
      had committed in giving way to a feeling of which she was now ashamed.
      What could do this better than hard work? To owe everything to herself, to
      her talents, to her efforts, to her industry, such was Jacqueline&rsquo;s ideal
      of her future life.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had, before this, crowned her brilliant reputation in the &lsquo;cours&rsquo; of
      M. Regis by passing her preliminary examination at the Sorbonne; she was
      confident of attaining the highest degree&mdash;the &lsquo;brevet superieur&rsquo;,
      and while pursuing her own studies she hoped to give lessons in music and
      in foreign languages, etc. Thus assured of making her own living, she
      could afford to despise the discreditable happiness of Madame de Nailles,
      who, she had no doubt, would shortly become Madame Marien; also the
      crooked ways in which M. de Cymier might pursue his fortune-hunting. She
      said to herself that she should never marry; that she had other objects of
      interest; that marriage was for those who had nothing better before them;
      and the world appeared to her under a new aspect, a sphere of useful
      activity full of possibilities, of infinite variety, and abounding in
      interests. Marriage might be all very well for rich girls, who unhappily
      were objects of value to be bought and sold; her semi-poverty gave her the
      right to break the chains that hampered the career of other well-born
      women&mdash;she would make her own way in the world like a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, at eighteen, youth is ready to set sail in a light skiff on a rough
      sea, having laid in a good store of imagination and of courage, of
      childlike ignorance and self-esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      No doubt she would meet with some difficulties; that thought did but
      excite her ardor. No doubt Madame de Nailles would try to keep her with
      her, and Jacqueline had provided herself beforehand with some double-edged
      remarks by way of weapons, which she intended to use according to
      circumstances. But all these preparations for defense or attack proved
      unnecessary. When she told the Baroness of her plans she met with no
      opposition. She had expected that her project of separation would highly
      displease her stepmother; on the contrary, Madame de Nailles discussed her
      projects quietly, affecting to consider them merely temporary, but with no
      indication of dissatisfaction or resistance. In truth she was not sorry
      that Jacqueline, whose companionship became more and more embarrassing
      every day, had cut the knot of a difficult position by a piece of
      wilfulness and perversity which seemed to put her in the wrong. The
      necessity she would have been under of crushing such a girl, who was now
      eighteen, would have been distasteful and unprofitable; she was very glad
      to get rid of her stepdaughter, always provided it could be done decently
      and without scandal. Those two, who had once so loved each other and who
      were now sharers in the same sorrows, became enemies&mdash;two hostile
      parties, which only skilful strategy could ever again bring together. They
      tacitly agreed to certain conditions: they would save appearances; they
      would remain on outwardly good terms with each other whatever happened,
      and above all they would avoid any explanation. This programme was
      faithfully carried out, thanks to the great tact of Madame de Nailles.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one could have been more watchful to appear ignorant of everything
      which, if once brought to light, would have led to difficulties; for
      instance, she feigned not to know that her stepdaughter was in possession
      of a secret which, if the world knew, would forever make them strangers to
      each other; nor would she seem aware that Hubert Marien, weary to death of
      the tie that bound him to her, was restrained from breaking it only by a
      scruple of honor. Thanks to this seeming ignorance, she parted from
      Jacqueline without any open breach, as she had long hoped to do, and she
      retained as a friend who supplied her wants a man who was only too happy
      to be allowed at this price to escape the act of reparation which
      Jacqueline, in her simplicity, had dreaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      All those who, having for years dined and danced under the roof of the
      Nailles, were accounted their friends by society, formed themselves into
      two parties, one of which lauded to the skies the dignity and resignation
      of the Baroness, while the other admired the force of character in
      Jacqueline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visitors flocked to the convent which the young girl, by the advice of
      Giselle, had chosen for her retreat because it was situated in a quiet
      quarter. She who looked so beautiful in her crape garments, who showed
      herself so satisfied in her little cell with hardly any furniture, who was
      grateful for the services rendered her by the lay sisters, content with
      having no salon but the convent parlor, who was passing examinations to
      become a teacher, and who seemed to consider it a favor to be sometimes
      allowed to hear the children in the convent school say their lessons&mdash;was
      surely like a heroine in a novel. And indeed Jacqueline had the agreeable
      sensation of considering herself one. Public admiration was a great help
      to her, after she had passed through that crisis in her grief during which
      she could feel nothing but the horror of knowing she should never see her
      father again, when she had ceased to weep for him incessantly, to pray for
      him, and to turn, like a wounded lioness, on those who blamed his reckless
      conduct, though she herself had been its chief victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three months she hardly left the convent, walking only in the grounds
      and gardens, which were of considerable extent. From time to time Giselle
      came for her and took her to drive in the Bois at that hour of the day
      when few people were there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enguerrand, who, thanks to his mother&rsquo;s care, was beginning to be an
      intelligent and interesting child, though he was still painfully like M.
      de Talbrun, was always with them in the coupe, kindhearted Giselle
      thinking that nothing could be so likely to assuage grief as the prattle
      of a child. She was astonished&mdash;she was touched to the heart, by what
      she called naively the conversion of Jacqueline. It was true that the
      young girl had no longer any whims or caprices. All the nuns seemed to her
      amiable, her lodging was all she needed, her food was excellent; her
      lessons gave her amusement. Possibly the excitement of the entire change
      had much to do at first with this philosophy, and in fact at the end of
      six months Jacqueline owned that she was growing tired of dining at the
      table d&rsquo;hote.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little knot of crooked old ladies who were righteous overmuch,
      and several sour old maids whose only occupation seemed to be to make
      remarks on any person who had anything different in dress, manners, or
      appearance from what they considered the type of the becoming. If it is
      not good that man should live alone, it is equally true that women should
      not live together. Jacqueline found this out as soon as her powers of
      observation came back to her. And about the same time she discovered that
      she was not so free as she had flattered herself she should be. The
      appearance of a lady, fair and with light hair, very pretty and about her
      own age, gave her for the first time an inclination to talk at table. She
      and this young woman met twice a day at their meals, in the morning and in
      the evening; their rooms were next each other, and at night Jacqueline
      could hear her through the thin partition giving utterance to sighs, which
      showed that she was unhappy. Several times, too, she came upon her in the
      garden looking earnestly at a place where the wall had been broken, a spot
      whence it was said a Spanish countess had been carried off by a bold
      adventurer. Jacqueline thought there must be something romantic in the
      history of this newcomer, and would have liked exceedingly to know what it
      might be. As a prelude to acquaintance, she offered the young stranger
      some holy water when they met in the chapel, a bow and a smile were
      interchanged, their fingers touched. They seemed almost friends. After
      this, Jacqueline contrived to change her seat at table to one next to this
      unknown person, so prettily dressed, with her hair so nicely arranged,
      and, though her expression was very sad, with a smile so very winning. She
      alone represented the world, the world of Paris, among all those ladies,
      some of whom were looking for places as companions, some having come up
      from the provinces, and some being old ladies who had seen better days.
      Her change of place was observed by the nun who presided at the table, and
      a shade of displeasure passed over her face. It was slight, but it
      portended trouble. And, indeed, when grace had been said, Mademoiselle de
      Nailles was sent for by the Mother Superior, who gave her to understand
      that, being so young, it was especially incumbent on her to be circumspect
      in her choice of associates. Her place thenceforward was to be between
      Madame de X&mdash;&mdash;-, an old, deaf lady, and Mademoiselle J&mdash;&mdash;-,
      a former governess, as cold as ice and exceedingly respectable. As to
      Madame Saville, she had been received in the convent for especial reasons,
      arising out of circumstances which did not make her a fit companion for
      inexperienced girls. The Superior hesitated a moment and then said: &ldquo;Her
      husband requested us to take charge of her,&rdquo; in a tone by which Jacqueline
      quite understood that &ldquo;take charge&rdquo; was a synonym for &ldquo;keep a strict watch
      upon her.&rdquo; She was spied upon, she was persecuted&mdash;unjustly, no
      doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this increased the interest that Jacqueline already felt in the lady
      with the light hair. But she made a low curtsey to the Mother Superior and
      returned no answer. Her intercourse with her neighbor was thenceforward;
      however, sly and secret, which only made it more interesting and exciting.
      They would exchange a few words when they met upon the stairs, in the
      garden, or in the cloisters, when there was no curious eye to spy them
      out; and the first time Jacqueline went out alone Madame Saville was on
      the watch, and, without speaking, slipped a letter into her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      This first time Jacqueline went out was an epoch in her life, as small
      events are sometimes in the annals of nations; it was the date of her
      emancipation, it coincided with what she called her choice of a career.
      Thinking herself sure of possessing a talent for teaching, she had spoken
      of it to several friends who had come to see her, and who each and all
      exclaimed that they would like some lessons, a delicate way of helping her
      quite understood by Jacqueline. Pupils like Belle Ray and Yvonne
      d&rsquo;Etaples, who wanted her to come twice a week to play duets with them or
      to read over new music, were not nearly so interesting as those in her
      little class who had hardly more than learned their scales! Besides this,
      Madame d&rsquo;Avrigny begged her to come and dine with her, when there would be
      only themselves, on Mondays, and then practise with Dolly, who had not
      another moment in which she could take a lesson. She should be sent home
      scrupulously before ten o&rsquo;clock, that being the hour at the convent when
      every one must be in. Jacqueline accepted all these kindnesses gratefully.
      By Giselle&rsquo;s advice she hid her slight figure under a loose cloak and put
      on her head a bonnet fit for a grandmother, a closed hat with long
      strings, which, when she first put it on her head, made her burst out
      laughing. She imagined herself to be going forth in disguise. To walk the
      streets thus masked she thought would be amusing, so amusing that the
      moment she set foot on the street pavement she felt that the joy of living
      was yet strong in her. With a roll of music in her hand, she walked on
      rather hesitatingly, a little afraid, like a bird just escaped from the
      cage where it was born; her heart beat, but it was with pleasure; she
      fancied every one was looking at her, and in fact one old gentleman, not
      deceived by the cloak, did follow her till she got into an omnibus for the
      first time in her life&mdash;a new experience and a new pleasure. Once
      seated, and a little out of breath, she remembered Madame Saville&rsquo;s
      letter, which she had slipped into her pocket. It was sealed and had a
      stamp on it; it was too highly scented to be in good taste, and it was
      addressed to a lieutenant of chasseurs with an aristocratic name, in a
      garrison at Fontainebleau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Jacqueline began vaguely to comprehend that Madame Saville&rsquo;s husband
      might have had serious reasons for commending his wife to the surveillance
      of the nuns, and that there might have been some excuse for their
      endeavoring to hinder all intimacy between herself and the little blonde.
    </p>
    <p>
      This office of messenger, thrust upon her without asking permission, was
      not agreeable to Jacqueline, and she resolved as she dropped the missive,
      which, even on the outside, looked compromising, into the nearest
      post-box, to be more reserved in future. For which reason she responded
      coldly to a sign Madame Saville made her when, in the evening, she
      returned from giving her lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those lessons&mdash;those excursions which took her abroad in all
      weathers, though with praiseworthy and serious motives, into the
      fashionable parts of Paris, from which she had exiled herself by her own
      will&mdash;were greatly enjoyed by Jacqueline. Everything amused her,
      being seen from a point of view in which she had never before contemplated
      it. She seemed to be at a play, all personal interests forgotten for the
      moment, looking at the world of which she was no longer a part with a
      lively, critical curiosity, without regrets but without cynicism. The
      world did not seem to her bad&mdash;only man&rsquo;s higher instincts had little
      part in it. Such, at least, was what she thought, so long as people
      praised her for her courage, so long as the houses in which another
      Jacqueline de Nailles had been once so brilliant, received her with
      affection as before, though she had to leave in an anteroom her modest
      waterproof or wet umbrella. They were even more kind and cordial to her
      than ever, unless an exaggerated cordiality be one form of impertinence.
      But the enthusiasm bestowed on splendid instances of energy in certain
      circles, to which after all such energy is a reproach, is superficial, and
      not being genuine is sure not to last long. Some people said that
      Jacqueline&rsquo;s staid manners were put on for effect, and that she was only
      attempting to play a difficult part to which she was not suited; others
      blamed her for not being up to concert-pitch in matters of social
      interest. The first time she felt the pang of exclusion was at Madame
      d&rsquo;Avrigny&rsquo;s, who was at the same moment overwhelming her with expressions
      of regard. In the first place, she could see that the little family dinner
      to which she had been so kindly invited was attended by so many guests
      that her deep mourning seemed out of place among them. Then Madame
      d&rsquo;Avrigny would make whispered explanations, which Jacqueline was
      conscious of, and which were very painful to her. Such words as: &ldquo;Old
      friend of the family;&rdquo; &ldquo;Is giving music lessons to my daughter;&rdquo; fell more
      than once upon her ear, followed by exclamations of &ldquo;Poor thing!&rdquo; &ldquo;So
      courageous!&rdquo; &ldquo;Chivalric sentiments!&rdquo; Of course, everyone added that they
      excused her toilette. Then when she tried to escape such remarks by
      wearing a new gown, Dolly, who was always a little fool (there is no cure
      for that infirmity) cried out in a tone such as she never would have dared
      to use in the days when Jacqueline was a model of elegance: &ldquo;Oh, how fine
      you are!&rdquo; Then again, Madame d&rsquo;Avrigny, notwithstanding the good manners
      on which she prided herself, could not conceal that the obligation of
      sending home the recluse to the ends of the earth, at a certain hour, made
      trouble with her servants, who were put out of their way. Jacqueline
      seized on this pretext to propose to give up the Monday music-lesson, and
      after some polite hesitation her offer was accepted, evidently to Madame
      d&rsquo;Avrigny&rsquo;s relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case she had the satisfaction of being the one to propose the
      discontinuance of the lessons. At Madame Ray&rsquo;s she was simply dismissed.
      About the close of winter she was told that as Isabelle was soon to be
      married she would have no time for music till her wedding was over, and
      about the same time the d&rsquo;Etaples told her much the same thing. This was
      not to be wondered at, for Mademoiselle Ray was engaged to an officer of
      dragoons, the same Marcel d&rsquo;Etaples who had acted with her in Scylla and
      Charybdis, and Madame Ray, being a watchful mother, was not long in
      perceiving that Marcel came to pay court to Isabelle too frequently at the
      hour for her music-lesson. Madame d&rsquo;Etaples on her part had made a similar
      discovery, and both judged that the presence of so beautiful a girl, in
      Jacqueline&rsquo;s position, might not be desirable in these interviews between
      lovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Giselle, as she was about to leave town for the country in July,
      begged Jacqueline, who seemed run down and out of spirits, to come and
      stay with her, the poor child was very glad to accept the invitation. Her
      pupils were leaving her one after another, she could not understand why,
      and she was bored to death in the convent, whose strict rules were drawn
      tighter on her than before, for the nuns had begun to understand her
      better, and to discover the real worldliness of her character. At the same
      time, that retreat within these pious walls no longer seemed like paradise
      to Jacqueline; her transition from the deepest crape to the softer tints
      of half mourning, seemed to make her less of an angel in their eyes. They
      said to each other that Mademoiselle de Nailles was fanciful, and fancies
      are the very last things wanted in a convent, for fancies can brave bolts,
      and make their escape beyond stone walls, whatever means may be taken to
      clip their wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does not seem like the same person,&rdquo; cried the good sisters, who had
      been greatly edified at first by her behavior, and who were almost ready
      now to be shocked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The course of things was coming back rapidly into its natural channel; in
      obedience to the law which makes a tree, apparently dead, put forth shoots
      in springtime. And that inevitable re-budding and reblossoming was
      beautiful to see in this young human plant. M. de Talbrun, Jacqueline&rsquo;s
      host, could not fail to perceive it. At first he had been annoyed with
      Giselle for giving the invitation, having a habit of finding fault with
      everything he had not ordered or suggested, by virtue of his marital
      authority, and also because he hated above all things, as he said, to have
      people in his house who were &ldquo;wobegones.&rdquo; But in a week he was quite
      reconciled to the idea of keeping Mademoiselle de Nailles all the summer
      at the Chateau de Fresne. Never had Giselle known him to take so much
      trouble to be amiable, and indeed Jacqueline saw him much more to
      advantage at home than in Paris, where, as she had often said, he diffused
      too strong an odor of the stables. At Fresne, it was more easy to forgive
      him for talking always of his stud and of his kennel, and then he was so
      obliging! Every day he proposed some new jaunt, an excursion to see some
      view, to visit all the ruined chateaux or abbeys in the neighborhood. And,
      with surprising delicacy, M. de Talbrun refrained from inviting too many
      of his country neighbors, who might perhaps have scared Jacqueline and
      arrested her gradual return to gayety. They might also have interrupted
      his tete-a-tete with his wife&rsquo;s guest, for they had many such
      conversations. Giselle was absorbed in the duty of teaching her son his a,
      b, c. Besides, being very timid, she had never ridden on horseback, and,
      naturally, riding was delightful to her cousin. Jacqueline was never tired
      of it; while she paid as little attention to the absurd remarks Oscar made
      to her between their gallops as a girl does at a ball to the idle words of
      her partner. She supposed it was his custom to talk in that manner&mdash;a
      sort of rough gallantry&mdash;but with the best intentions. Jacqueline was
      disposed to look upon her life at Fresne as a feast after a long famine.
      Everything was to her taste, the whole appearance of this lordly chateau
      of the time of Louis XIII, the splendid trees in the home park, the
      gardens laid out &lsquo;a la Francais&rsquo;, decorated with art and kept up
      carefully. Everything, indeed, that pertained to that high life which to
      Giselle had so little importance, was to her delightful. Giselle&rsquo;s taste
      was so simple that it was a constant subject of reproach from her husband.
      To be sure, it was with him a general rule to find fault with her about
      everything. He did not spare her his reproaches on a multitude of
      subjects; all day long he was worrying her about small trifles with which
      he should have had nothing to do. It is a mistake to suppose that a man
      can not be brutal and fussy at the same time. M. de Talbrun was proof to
      the contrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too patient,&rdquo; said Jacqueline often to Giselle. &ldquo;You ought to
      answer him back&mdash;to defend yourself. I am sure if you did so you
      would have him, by-and-bye, at your beck and call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so. I dare say you could have managed better than I do,&rdquo; replied
      Giselle, with a sad smile, but without a spark of jealousy. &ldquo;Oh, you are
      in high favor. He gave up this week the races at Deauville, the great race
      week from which he has never before been absent, since our marriage. But
      you see my ambition has become limited; I am satisfied if he lets me
      alone.&rdquo; Giselle spoke these words with emphasis, and then she added: &ldquo;and
      lets me bring up his son my own way. That is all I ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline thought in her heart that it was wrong to ask so little, that
      poor Giselle did not know how to make the best of her husband, and,
      curious to find out what line of conduct would serve best to subjugate M.
      de Talbrun, she became herself&mdash;that is to say, a born coquette&mdash;venturing
      from one thing to another, like a child playing fearlessly with a bulldog,
      who is gentle only with him, or a fly buzzing round a spider&rsquo;s web, while
      the spider lies quietly within.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would tease him, contradict him, and make him listen to long pieces of
      scientific music as she played them on the piano, when she knew he always
      said that music to him was nothing but a disagreeable noise; she would
      laugh at his thanks when a final chord, struck with her utmost force,
      roused him from a brief slumber; in short, it amused her to prove that
      this coarse, rough man was to her alone no object of fear. She would have
      done better had she been afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it came to pass that, as they rode together through some of the
      prettiest roads in the most beautiful part of Normandy, M. de Talbrun
      began to talk, with an ever-increasing vivacity, of the days when they
      first met, at Treport, relating a thousand little incidents which
      Jacqueline had forgotten, and from which it was easy to see that he had
      watched her narrowly, though he was on the eve of his own marriage. With
      unnecessary persistence, and stammering as he was apt to do when moved by
      any emotion, he repeated over and over again, that from the first moment
      he had seen her he had been struck by her&mdash;devilishly struck by her&mdash;he
      had been, indeed! And one day when she answered, in order not to appear to
      attach any importance to this declaration, that she was very glad of it,
      he took an opportunity, as their horses stopped side by side before a
      beautiful sunset, to put his arm suddenly round her waist, and give her a
      kiss, so abrupt, so violent, so outrageous, that she screamed aloud. He
      did not remove his arm from her, his coarse, red face drew near her own
      again with an expression that filled her with horror. She struggled to
      free herself, her horse began to rear, she screamed for help with all her
      might, but nothing answered her save an echo. The situation seemed
      critical for Jacqueline. As to M. de Talbrun, he was quite at his ease, as
      if he were accustomed to make love like a centaur; while the girl felt
      herself in peril of being thrown at any moment, and trampled under his
      horse&rsquo;s feet. At last she succeeded in striking her aggressor a sharp blow
      across the face with her riding-whip. Blinded for a moment, he let her go,
      and she took advantage of her release to put her horse to its full speed.
      He galloped after her, beside himself with wrath and agitation; it was a
      mad but silent race, until they reached the gate of the Chateau de Fresne,
      which they entered at the same moment, their horses covered with foam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How foolish!&rdquo; cried Giselle, coming to meet them. &ldquo;Just see in what a
      state you have brought home your poor horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline, pale and trembling, made no answer. M. de Talbrun, as he
      helped her to dismount, whispered, savagely: &ldquo;Not a word of this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At dinner, his wife remarked that some branch must have struck him on the
      cheek, there was a red mark right across his face like a blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were riding through the woods,&rdquo; he answered, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Giselle began to suspect something, and remarked that nobody was
      talking that evening, asking, with a half-smile, whether they had been
      quarrelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did have a little difference,&rdquo; Oscar replied, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it did not amount to anything,&rdquo; he said, lighting his cigar; &ldquo;let us
      make friends again, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he added, holding out his hand to
      Jacqueline. She was obliged to give him the tips of her fingers, as she
      said in her turn, with audacity equal to his own:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it was less than nothing. Only, Giselle, I told your husband that I
      had had some bad news, and shall have to go back to Paris, and he tried to
      persuade me not to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg you not to go,&rdquo; said Oscar, vehemently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad news?&rdquo; repeated Giselle, &ldquo;you did not say a word to me about it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not have a chance. My old Modeste is very ill and asks me to come
      to her. I should never forgive myself if I did not go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Modeste? So very ill? Is it really so serious? What a pity! But you
      will come back again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can. But I must leave Fresne to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I defy you to leave Fresne!&rdquo; said M. de Talbrun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline leaned toward him, and said firmly, but in a low voice: &ldquo;If you
      attempt to hinder me, I swear I will tell everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All that evening she did not leave Giselle&rsquo;s side for a moment, and at
      night she locked herself into her chamber and barricaded the door, as if a
      mad dog or a murderer were at large in the chateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giselle came into her room at an early hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is what you said yesterday the truth, Jacqueline? Is Modeste really ill?
      Are you sure you have had no reason to complain of anybody in this place?&mdash;of
      any one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, after a pause, she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my darling, how hard it is to do good even to those whom we most
      dearly love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, with an effort. &ldquo;Everybody has
      been kind to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They kissed each other with effusion, but M. de Talbrun&rsquo;s leave-taking was
      icy in the extreme. Jacqueline had made a mortal enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grand outline of the chateau, built of brick and stone with its wings
      flanked by towers, the green turf of the great park in which it stood,
      passed from her sight as she drove away, like some vision in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never come back&mdash;never come back!&rdquo; thought Jacqueline. She
      felt as if she had been thrust out everywhere. For one moment she thought
      of seeking refuge at Lizerolles, which was not very many miles from the
      railroad station, and when there of telling Madame d&rsquo;Argy of her
      difficulties, and asking her advice; but false pride kept her from doing
      so&mdash;the same false pride which had made her write coldly, in answer
      to the letters full of feeling and sympathy Fred had written to her on
      receiving news of her father&rsquo;s death.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. TREACHEROUS KINDNESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The experience through which Jacqueline had just passed was not calculated
      to fortify her or to elevate her soul. She felt for the first time that
      her unprotected situation and her poverty exposed her to insult, for what
      other name could she give to the outrageous behavior of M. de Talbrun,
      which had degraded her in her own eyes?
    </p>
    <p>
      What right had that man to treat her as his plaything? Her pride and all
      her womanly instincts rose up in rebellion. Her nerves had been so shaken
      that she sobbed behind her veil all the way to her destination. Paris,
      when she reached it, offered her almost nothing that could comfort or
      amuse her. That city is always empty and dull in August, more so than at
      any other season. Even the poor occupation of teaching her little class of
      music pupils had been taken away by the holidays. Her sole resource was in
      Modeste&rsquo;s society. Modeste&mdash;who, by the way, had never been ill, and
      who suffered from nothing but old age&mdash;was delighted to receive her
      dear young lady in her little room far up under the roof, where, though
      quite infirm, she lived comfortably, on her savings. Jacqueline, sitting
      beside her as she sewed, was soothed by her old nursery tales, or by
      anecdotes of former days. Her own relatives were often the old woman&rsquo;s
      theme. She knew the history of Jacqueline&rsquo;s family from beginning to end;
      but, wherever her story began, it invariably wound up with:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only your poor papa had not made away with all your money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Jacqueline always answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was quite at liberty to do what he pleased with what belonged to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belonged to him! Yes, but what belonged to you? And how does it happen
      that your stepmother seems so well off? Why doesn&rsquo;t some family council
      interfere? My little pet, to think of your having to work for your living.
      It&rsquo;s enough to kill me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! Modeste, there are worse things than being poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; answered the old nurse, doubtfully, &ldquo;but when one has money
      troubles along with the rest, the money troubles make other things harder
      to bear; whereas, if you have money enough you can bear anything, and you
      would have had enough, after all, if you had married Monsieur Fred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At which point Jacqueline insisted that Modeste should be silent, and
      answered, resolutely: &ldquo;I mean never to marry at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this Modeste made answer: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s another of your notions. The worst
      husband is always better than none; and I know, for I never married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you talk such nonsense, my poor dear Modeste! You know nothing
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One day, after one of these visits to the only friend, as she believed,
      who remained to her in the world&mdash;for her intimacy with Giselle was
      spoiled forever&mdash;she saw, as she walked with a heavy heart toward her
      convent in a distant quarter, an open fiacre pull up, in obedience to a
      sudden cry from a passenger who was sitting inside. The person sprang out,
      and rushed toward Jacqueline with loud exclamations of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Strahlberg!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Jacqueline! What a pleasure to meet you!&rdquo; And, the street being
      nearly empty, Madame Strahlberg heartily embraced her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought of you so often, darling, for months past&mdash;they seem
      like years, like centuries! Where have you been all that long time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In point of fact, Jacqueline had no proof that the three Odinska ladies
      had ever remembered her existence, but that might have been partly her own
      fault, or rather the fault of Giselle, who had made her promise to have as
      little as possible to do with such compromising personages. She was seized
      with a kind of remorse when she found such warmth of recognition from the
      amiable Wanda. Had she not shown herself ungrateful and cowardly? People
      about whom the world talks, are they not sometimes quite as good as those
      who have not lost their standing in society, like M. de Talbrun? It seemed
      to her that, go where she would, she ran risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cynicism that is the result of sad experience was beginning to show
      itself in Jacqueline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, forgive me!&rdquo; she said, feeling, contrite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive you for what, you beautiful creature?&rdquo; asked Madame Strahlberg,
      with sincere astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had the excellent custom of never observing when people neglected her,
      or at least, of never showing that she did so, partly because her life was
      so full of varied interests that she cared little for such trifles, and
      secondly because, having endured several affronts of that nature, she had
      ceased to be very sensitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew, through the d&rsquo;Avrignys,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you were still at the
      convent. You are not going to take the veil there, are you? It would be a
      great pity. No? You wish to lead the life of an intelligent woman who is
      free and independent? That is well; but it was rather an odd idea to begin
      by going into a cloister. Oh!&mdash;I see, public opinion?&rdquo; And Madame
      Strahlberg made a little face, expressive of her contempt for public
      opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does not pay to consult other people&rsquo;s opinions&mdash;it is useless,
      believe me. The more we sacrifice to public opinion, the more it asks of
      us. I cut that matter short long ago. But how glad I am to hear that you
      don&rsquo;t intend to hide that lovely face in a convent. You are looking better
      than ever&mdash;a little too pale, still, perhaps&mdash;a little too
      interesting. Colette will be so glad to see you, for you must let me take
      you home with me. I shall carry you off, whether you will or not, now I
      have caught you. We will have a little music just among ourselves, as we
      had in the good old times&mdash;you know, our dear music; you will feel
      like yourself again. Ah, art&mdash;there is nothing to compare with art in
      this world, my darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline yielded without hesitation, only too glad of the unhoped-for
      good fortune which relieved her from her ennui and her depression. And
      soon the hired victoria was on its way to that quarter of the city which
      is made up of streets with geographical names, and seems as if it were
      intended to lodge all the nations under heaven. It stopped in the Rue de
      Naples, before a house that was somewhat showy, but which showed from its
      outside, that it was not inhabited by high-bred people. There were pink
      linings to lace curtains at the windows, and quantities of green vines
      drooped from the balconies, as if to attract attention from the
      passers-by. Madame Strahlberg, with her ostentatious and undulating walk,
      which caused men to turn and notice her as she went by, went swiftly up
      the stairs to the second story. She put one finger on the electric bell,
      which caused two or three little dogs inside to begin barking, and pushed
      Jacqueline in before her, crying: &ldquo;Colette! Mamma! See whom I have brought
      back to you!&rdquo; Meantime doors were hurriedly opened, quick steps resounded
      in the antechamber, and the newcomer found herself received with a torrent
      of affectionate and delighted exclamations, pressed to the ample bosom of
      Madame Odinska, covered with kisses by Colette, and fawned upon by the
      three toy terriers, the most sociable of their kind in all Paris, their
      mistresses declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline was passing through one of those moments when one is at the
      mercy of chance, when the heart which has been closed by sorrow suddenly
      revives, expands, and softens under the influence of a ray of sunshine.
      Tears came into her eyes, and she murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends&mdash;my kind friends!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your friends, whatever happens, now and always,&rdquo; said Colette,
      eagerly, though she had probably barely given a thought to Jacqueline for
      eighteen months. Nevertheless, on seeing her, Colette really thought she
      had not for a moment ceased to be fond of her. &ldquo;How you have suffered, you
      poor pussy! We must set to work and make you feel a little gay, at any
      price. You see, it is our duty. How lucky you came to-day&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sign from her sister stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They carried Jacqueline into a large and handsome salon, full of dust and
      without curtains, with all the furniture covered up as if the family were
      on the eve of going to the country. Madame Strahlberg, nevertheless, was
      not about to leave Paris, her habit being to remain there in the summer,
      sometimes for months, picnicking as it were, in her own apartment. What
      was curious, too, was that the chandelier and all the side-lights had
      fresh wax candles, and seats were arranged as if in preparation for a
      play, while near the grand piano was a sort of stage, shut off from the
      rest of the room by screens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colette sat down on one of the front row of chairs and cried: &ldquo;I am the
      audience&mdash;I am all ears.&rdquo; Her sister hurriedly explained all this to
      Jacqueline, with out waiting to be questioned: &ldquo;We have been giving some
      little summer entertainments of late, of which you see the remains.&rdquo; She
      went at once to the piano, and incited Jacqueline to sing by beginning one
      of their favorite duets, and Jacqueline, once more in her native element,
      followed her lead. They went on from one song to another, from the light
      to the severe, from scientific music to mere tunes and airs, turning over
      the old music-books together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are a little out of practice, but all you have to do is to rub
      off the rust. Your voice is finer than ever&mdash;just like velvet.&rdquo; And
      Madame Strahlberg pretended that she envied the fine mezzo-soprano,
      speaking disparagingly of her own little thread of a voice, which,
      however, she managed so skilfully. &ldquo;What a shame to take up your time
      teaching, with such a voice as that!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;you are out of your
      senses, my dear, you are raving mad. It would be sinful to keep your gifts
      to yourself! I am very sorry to discourage you, but you have none of the
      requisites for a teacher. The stage would be best for you&mdash;&lsquo;Mon Dieu!
      why not? You will see La Rochette this evening; she is a person who would
      give you good advice. I wish she could hear you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my dear friend, I can not stay,&rdquo; murmured Jacqueline, for those
      unexpected words &ldquo;the stage, why not?&rdquo; rang in her head, made her heart
      beat fast, and made lights dance before her eyes. &ldquo;They are expecting me
      to dine at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your convent? I beg your pardon, I&rsquo;ll take care of that. Don&rsquo;t you
      know me? My claws seldom let go of a prize, especially when that prize is
      worth the keeping. A little telegram has already been sent, with your
      excuses. The telegraph is good for that, if not for anything else: it
      facilitates &lsquo;impromptus&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long live impromptus,&rdquo; cried out Colette, &ldquo;there is nothing like them for
      fun!&rdquo; And while Jacqueline was trying to get away, not knowing exactly
      what she was saying, but frightened, pleased, and much excited, Colette
      went on: &ldquo;Oh! I am so glad, so glad you came to-day; now you can see the
      pantomime! I dreamed, wasn&rsquo;t it odd, only last night, that you were acting
      it with us. How can one help believing in presentiments? Mine are always
      delightful&mdash;and yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pantomime?&rdquo; repeated Jacqueline in bewilderment, &ldquo;but I thought your
      sister told me you were all alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could we have anything like company in August?&rdquo; said Madame
      Strahlberg, interrupting her; &ldquo;why, it would be impossible, there are not
      four cats in Paris. No, no, we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have anybody. A few friends
      possibly may drop in&mdash;people passing through Paris&mdash;in their
      travelling-dresses. Nothing that need alarm you. The pantomime Colette
      talks about is only a pretext that they may hear Monsieur Szmera.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And who was M. Szmera?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline soon learned that he was a Hungarian, second half-cousin of a
      friend of Kossuth, the most wonderful violinist of the day, who had
      apparently superseded the famous Polish pianist in these ladies&rsquo; interest
      and esteem. As for the latter, they had almost forgotten his name, he had
      behaved so badly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, anxiously, &ldquo;you know I am obliged to be home by
      ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s like Cinderella,&rdquo; laughed Wanda. &ldquo;Will the stroke of the clock
      change all the carriages in Paris into pumpkins? One can get &lsquo;fiacres&rsquo; at
      any hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is a fixed rule: I must be in,&rdquo; repeated Jacqueline, growing very
      uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must you really? Madame Saville says it is very easy to manage those nuns&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Do you know Madame Saville, who was boarding at the convent last
      winter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed; she is a countrywoman of ours, a friend, the most charming
      of women. You will see her here this evening. She has gained her divorce
      suit&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; said Colette, &ldquo;she has lost it. But that makes no
      difference. She has got tired of her husband. Come, say &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; Jacqueline&mdash;a
      nice, dear &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;&mdash;you will stay, will you not? Oh, you darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They dined without much ceremony, on the pretext that the cook had been
      turned off that morning for impertinence, but immediately after dinner
      there was a procession of boys from a restaurant, bringing whipped creams,
      iced drinks, fruits, sweetmeats, and champagne&mdash;more than would have
      been wanted at the buffet of a ball. The Prince, they said, had sent these
      things. What Prince?
    </p>
    <p>
      As Jacqueline was asking this question, a gentleman came in whose age it
      would have been impossible to guess, so disguised was he by his black wig,
      his dyed whiskers, and the soft bloom on his cheeks, all of which were
      entirely out of keeping with those parts of his face that he could not
      change. In one of his eyes was stuck a monocle. He was bedizened with
      several orders, he bowed with military stiffness, and kissed with much
      devotion the ladies&rsquo; hands, calling them by titles, whether they had them
      or not. His foreign accent made it as hard to detect his nationality as it
      was to know his age. Two or three other gentlemen, not less decorated and
      not less foreign, afterward came in. Colette named them in a whisper to
      Jacqueline, but their names were too hard for her to pronounce, much less
      to remember. One of them, a man of handsome presence, came accompanied by
      a sort of female ruin, an old lady leaning on a cane, whose head, every
      time she moved, glittered with jewels, placed in a very lofty erection of
      curled hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That gentleman&rsquo;s mother is awfully ugly,&rdquo; Jacqueline could not help
      saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His mother? What, the Countess? She is neither his mother nor his wife.
      He is her gentleman-in-waiting-that&rsquo;s all. Don&rsquo;t you understand? Well,
      imagine a man who is a sort of &lsquo;gentleman-companion&rsquo;; he keeps her
      accounts, he escorts her to the theatre, he gives her his arm. It is a
      very satisfactory arrangement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentleman receives a salary, in such a case?&rdquo; inquired Jacqueline,
      much amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what do you find in it so extraordinary?&rdquo; said Colette. &ldquo;She adores
      cards, and there he is, always ready to be her partner. Oh, here comes
      dear Madame Saville!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were fresh cries of welcome, fresh exchanges of affectionate
      diminutives and kisses, which seemed to make the Prince&rsquo;s mouth water.
      Jacqueline discovered, to her great surprise, that she, too, was a dear
      friend of Madame Saville&rsquo;s, who called her her good angel, in reference,
      no doubt, to the letter she had secretly put into the post. At last she
      said, trying to make her escape from the party: &ldquo;But it must be nine
      o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but&mdash;you must hear Szmera.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A handsome young fellow, stoutly built, with heavy eyebrows, a hooked
      nose, a quantity of hair growing low upon his forehead, and lips that were
      too red, the perfect type of a Hungarian gypsy, began a piece of his own
      composition, which had all the ardor of a mild &lsquo;galopade&rsquo; and a Satanic
      hunt, with intervals of dying sweetness, during which the painted skeleton
      they called the Countess declared that she certainly heard a nightingale
      warbling in the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      This charming speech was forthwith repeated by her &ldquo;umbra&rdquo; in all parts of
      the room, which was now nearly filled with people, a mixed multitude, some
      of whom were frantic about music, others frantic about Wanda Strahlberg.
      There were artists and amateurs present, and even respectable women, for
      Madame d&rsquo;Avrigny, attracted by the odor of a species of Bohemianism, had
      come to breathe it with delight, under cover of a wish to glean ideas for
      her next winter&rsquo;s receptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then again there were women who had been dropped out of society, like
      Madame de Versanne, who, with her sunken eyes and faded face, was not
      likely again to pick up in the street a bracelet worth ten thousand
      francs. There was a literary woman who signed herself Fraisiline, and
      wrote papers on fashion&mdash;she was so painted and bedizened that some
      one remarked that the principal establishments she praised in print
      probably paid her in their merchandise. There was a dowager whose
      aristocratic name appeared daily on the fourth page of the newspapers,
      attesting the merits of some kind of quack medicine; and a retired
      opera-singer, who, having been called Zenaide Rochet till she grew up in
      Montmartre, where she was born, had had a brilliant career as a star in
      Italy under the name of Zina Rochette. La Rochette&rsquo;s name, alas! is
      unknown to the present generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all, there were about twenty persons, who made more noise with their
      applause than a hundred ordinary guests, for enthusiasm was exacted by
      Madame Strahlberg. Profiting by the ovation to the Hungarian musician,
      Jacqueline made a movement toward the door, but just as she reached it she
      had the misfortune of falling in with her old acquaintance, Nora Sparks,
      who was at that moment entering with her father. She was forced to sit
      down again and hear all about Kate&rsquo;s marriage. Kate had gone back to New
      York, her husband being an American, but Nora said she had made up her
      mind not to leave Europe till she had found a satisfactory match.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better make haste about it, if you expect to keep me here,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Sparks, with a peculiar expression in his eye. He was eager to get
      home, having important business to attend to in the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, papa, be quiet! I shall find somebody at Bellagio. Why, darling, are
      you still in mourning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had forgotten that Jacqueline had lost her father. Probably she would
      not have thought it necessary to wear black so long for Mr. Sparks.
      Meantime, Madame Strahlberg and her sister had left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are they coming back?&rdquo; said Jacqueline, growing very nervous. &ldquo;It
      seems to me this clock must be wrong. It says half-past nine. I am sure it
      must be later than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half-past nine!&mdash;why, it is past eleven,&rdquo; replied Miss Nora, with a
      giggle. &ldquo;Do you suppose they pay any attention to clocks in this house?
      Everything here is topsy-turvy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what shall I do?&rdquo; sighed poor Jacqueline, on the verge of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, do they keep you such a prisoner as that? Can&rsquo;t you come in a little
      late&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t open the doors&mdash;they never open the doors on any
      pretext after ten o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; cried Jacqueline, beside herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then your nuns must be savages? You should teach them better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be worried, dear little one, you can sleep on this sofa,&rdquo; said
      Madame Odinska, kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To whom had she not offered that useful sofa? Wanda and Colette were just
      as ready to propose that others should spend the night with them as, on
      the smallest pretext, to accept the same hospitality from others. Wanda,
      indeed, always slept curled up like a cat on a divan, in a fur wrapper,
      which she put on early in the evening when she wanted to smoke cigarettes.
      She went to sleep at no regular hour. A bear&rsquo;s skin was placed always
      within her reach, so that if she were cold she could draw it over her.
      Jacqueline, not being accustomed to these Polish fashions, did not seem to
      be much attracted by the offer of the sofa. She blamed herself bitterly
      for her own folly in having got herself into a scrape which might lead to
      serious consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was neither time nor place for expressions of anxiety; it would
      be absurd to trouble every one present with her regrets. Besides, the harm
      was done&mdash;it was irreparable&mdash;and while she was turning over in
      her mind in what manner she could explain to the Mother Superior that the
      mistake about the hour had been no fault of hers&mdash;and the Mother
      Superior, alas! would be sure to make inquiries as to the friends whom she
      had visited&mdash;the magic violin of M. Szmera played its first notes,
      accompanied by Madame Odinska on the piano, and by a delicious little
      flute. They played an overture, the dreamy sweetness of which extorted
      cries of admiration from all the women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, the screens parted, and upon the little platform that
      represented a stage bounded a sort of anomalous being, supple and
      charming, in the traditional dress of Pierrot, whom the English vulgarize
      and call Harlequin. He had white camellias instead of buttons on his loose
      white jacket, and the bright eyes of Wanda shone out from his
      red-and-white face. He held a mandolin, and imitated the most charming of
      serenades, before a make-believe window, which, being opened by a white,
      round arm, revealed Colette, dressed as Colombine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little pantomime piece was called &lsquo;Pierrot in Love&rsquo;. It consisted of a
      series of dainty coquetries, sudden quarrels, fits of jealousy, and tender
      reconciliations, played by the two sisters. Colette with her beauty, Wanda
      with her talent, her impishness, her graceful and voluptuous attitudes,
      electrified the spectators, especially in a long monologue, in which
      Pierrot contemplated suicide, made more effective by the passionate and
      heart-piercing strains of the Hungarian&rsquo;s violin, so that old Rochette
      cried out: &ldquo;What a pity such a wonder should not be upon the stage!&rdquo; La
      Rochette, now retired into private life, wearing an old dress, with her
      gray hair and her black eyes, like those of a watchful crocodile, took the
      pleasure in the pantomime that all actors do to the very last in
      everything connected with the theatre. She cried &lsquo;brava&rsquo; in tones that
      might reach Italy; she blew kisses to the actors in default of flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame d&rsquo;Avrigny was also transported to the sixth heaven, but
      Jacqueline&rsquo;s presence somewhat marred her pleasure. When she first
      perceived her she had shown great surprise. &ldquo;You here, my dear?&rdquo; she
      cried, &ldquo;I thought you safe with our own excellent Giselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safe, Madame? It seems to me one can be safe anywhere,&rdquo; Jacqueline
      answered, though she was tempted to say &ldquo;safe nowhere;&rdquo; but instead she
      inquired for Dolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly&rsquo;s mother bit her lips and then replied: &ldquo;You see I have not brought
      her. Oh, yes, this house is very amusing&mdash;but rather too much so. The
      play was very pretty, and I am sorry it would not do at my house. It is
      too&mdash;too &lsquo;risque&rsquo;, you know;&rdquo; and she rehearsed her usual speech
      about the great difficulties encountered by a lady who wished to give
      entertainments and provide amusement for her friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Pierrot, or rather Madame Strahlberg, had leaped over an
      imaginary barrier and came dancing toward the company, shaking her large
      sleeves and settling her little snake-like head in her large quilled
      collar, dragging after her the Hungarian, who seemed not very willing. She
      presented him to Madame d&rsquo;Avrigny, hoping that so fashionable a woman
      might want him to play at her receptions during the winter, and to a
      journalist who promised to give him a notice in his paper, provided&mdash;and
      here he whispered something to Pierrot, who, smiling, answered neither yes
      nor no. The sisters kept on their costumes; Colette was enchanting with
      her bare neck, her long-waisted black velvet corsage, her very short
      skirt, and a sort of three-cornered hat upon her head. All the men paid
      court to her, and she accepted their homage, becoming gayer and gayer at
      every compliment, laughing loudly, possibly that her laugh might exhibit
      her beautiful teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wanda, as Pierrot, sang, with her hands in her pockets, a Russian village
      song: &ldquo;Ah! Dounai-li moy Dounai&rdquo; (&ldquo;Oh! thou, my Danube&rdquo;). Then she
      imperiously called Jacqueline to the piano:&mdash;&ldquo;It is your turn now,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;most humble violet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up to that moment, Jacqueline&rsquo;s deep mourning had kept the gentlemen
      present from addressing her, though she had been much stared at. Although
      she did not wish to sing, for her heart was heavy as she thought of the
      troubles that awaited her the next day at the convent, she sang what was
      asked of her without resistance or pretension. Then, for the first time,
      she experienced the pride of triumph. Szmera, though he was furious at not
      being the sole lion of the evening, complimented her, bowing almost to the
      ground, with one hand on his heart; Madame Rochette assured her that she
      had a fortune in her throat whenever she chose to seek it; persons she had
      never seen and who did not know her name, pressed her hands fervently,
      saying that her singing was adorable. All cried &ldquo;Encore,&rdquo; &ldquo;Encore!&rdquo; and,
      yielding to the pleasure of applause, she thought no more of the flight of
      time. Dawn was peeping through the windows when the party broke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind people!&rdquo; thought the debutante, whom they had encouraged and
      applauded; &ldquo;some perhaps are a little odd, but how much cordiality and
      warmth there is among them! It is catching. This is the sort of atmosphere
      in which talent should live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Being very much fatigued, she fell asleep upon the offered sofa,
      half-pleased, half-frightened, but with two prominent convictions: one,
      that she was beginning to return to life; the other, that she stood on the
      edge of a precipice. In her dreams old Rochette appeared to her, her face
      like that of an affable frog, her dress the dress of Pierrot, and she
      croaked out, in a variety of tones: &ldquo;The stage! Why not? Applauded every
      night&mdash;it would be glorious!&rdquo; Then she seemed in her dream to be
      falling, falling down from a great height, as one falls from fairyland
      into stern reality. She opened her eyes: it was noon. Madame Odinska was
      waiting for her: she intended herself to take her to the convent, and for
      that purpose had assumed the imposing air of a noble matron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! it was in vain! Jacqueline, was made to understand that such an
      infraction of the rules could not be overlooked. To pass the night without
      leave out of the convent, and not with her own family, was cause for
      expulsion. Neither the prayers nor the anger of Madame Odinska had any
      power to change the sentence. While the Mother Superior calmly pronounced
      her decree, she was taking the measure of this stout foreigner who
      appeared in behalf of Jacqueline, a woman overdressed, yet at the same
      time shabby, who had a far from well-bred or aristocratic air. &ldquo;Out of
      consideration for Madame de Talbrun,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the convent consents to
      keep Mademoiselle de Nailles a few days longer&mdash;a few weeks perhaps,
      until she can find some other place to go. That is all we can do for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline listened to this sentence as she might have watched a game of
      dice when her fate hung on the result, but she showed no emotion. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo;
       she thought, &ldquo;my fate has been decided; respectable people will have
      nothing more to do with me. I will go with the others, who, perhaps, after
      all are not worse, and who most certainly are more amusing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fortnight after this, Madame de Nailles, having come back to Paris, from
      some watering-place, was telling Marien that Jacqueline had started for
      Bellagio with Mr. and Miss Sparks, the latter having taken a notion that
      she wanted that kind of chaperon who is called a companion in England and
      America.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they are of the same age,&rdquo; said Marien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just what Miss Sparks wants. She does not wish to be hampered by
      an elderly chaperon, but to be accompanied, as she would have been by her
      sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacqueline will be exposed to see strange things; how could you have
      consented&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consented? As if she cared for my consent! And then she manages to say
      such irritating things as soon as one attempts to blame her or advise her.
      For example, this is one of them: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you suppose,&rsquo; she said to me,
      &lsquo;that every one will take the most agreeable chance that offers for a
      visit to Italy?&rsquo; What do you think of that allusion? It closed my lips
      absolutely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps she did not mean what you think she meant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so? And when I warned her against Madame Strahlberg, saying
      that she might set her a very bad example, she answered: &lsquo;I may have had
      worse.&rsquo; I suppose that was not meant for impertinence either!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Hubert Marien, biting his lips doubtfully, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent a few moments, his head drooped on his breast, he was in
      some painful reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on. What are you thinking about?&rdquo; asked Madame de Nailles,
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon. I was only thinking that a certain responsibility
      might rest on those who have made that young girl what she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; said the stepmother, with an impatient gesture.
      &ldquo;Who can do anything to counteract a bad disposition? You don&rsquo;t deny that
      hers is bad? She is a very devil for pride and obstinacy&mdash;she has no
      affection&mdash;she has proved it. I have no inclination to get myself
      wounded by trying to control her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you prefer to let her ruin herself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should prefer not to give the world a chance to talk, by coming to an
      open rupture with her, which would certainly be the case if I tried to
      contradict her. After all, the Sparks and Madame Odinska are not yet put
      out of the pale of good society, and she knew them long ago. An early
      intimacy may be a good explanation if people blame her for going too far&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it, then; if you are satisfied it is not for me to say anything,&rdquo;
       replied Marien, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Satisfied? I am not satisfied with anything or anybody,&rdquo; said Madame de
      Nailles, indignantly. &ldquo;How could I be satisfied; I never have met with
      anything but ingratitude.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVI. THE SAILOR&rsquo;S RETURN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Madame D&rsquo;Argy did not leave her son in ignorance of all the freaks and
      follies of Jacqueline. He knew every particular of the wrong-doings and
      the imprudences of his early friend, and even the additions made to them
      by calumny, ever since the fit of in dependence which, after her father&rsquo;s
      death, had led her to throw off all control. She told of her sudden
      departure from Fresne, where she might have found so safe a refuge with
      her friend and cousin. Then had not her own imprudence and coquetry led to
      a rupture with the families of d&rsquo;Etaples and Ray? She told of the
      scandalous intimacy with Madame Strahlberg; of her expulsion from the
      convent, where they had discovered, even before she left, that she had
      been in the habit of visiting undesirable persons; and finally she
      informed him that Jacqueline had gone to Italy with an old Yankee and his
      daughter&mdash;he being a man, it was said, who had laid the foundation of
      his colossal fortune by keeping a bar-room in a mining camp in California.
      This last was no fiction, the cut of Mr. Sparks&rsquo;s beard and his unpolished
      manners left no doubt on the subject; and she wound up by saying that
      Madame d&rsquo;Avrigny, whom no one could accuse of ill-nature, had been grieved
      at meeting this unhappy girl in very improper company, among which she
      seemed quite in her element, like a fish in water. It was said also that
      she was thinking of studying for the stage with La Rochette&mdash;M. de
      Talbrun had heard it talked about in the foyer of the Opera by an old
      Prince from some foreign country&mdash;she could not remember his name,
      but he was praising Madame Strahlberg without any reserve as the most
      delightful of Parisiennes. Thereupon Talbrun had naturally forbidden his
      wife to have anything to do with Jacqueline, or even to write to her. Fat
      Oscar, though he was not all that he ought to be himself, had some very
      strict notions of propriety. No one was more particular about family
      relations, and really in this case no one could blame him; but Giselle had
      been very unhappy, and to the very last had tried to stand up for her
      unhappy friend. Having told him all this, she added, she would say no more
      on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giselle was a model woman in everything, in tact, in goodness, in good
      sense, and she was very attentive to the poor old mother of Fred, who but
      for her must have died long ago of loneliness and sorrow. Thereupon ensued
      the poor lady&rsquo;s usual lamentations over the long, long absence of her
      beloved son; as usual, she told him she did not think she should live to
      see him back again; she gave him a full account of her maladies, caused,
      or at least aggravated, by her mortal, constant, incurable sorrow; and she
      told how Giselle had been nursing her with all the patience and devotion
      of a Sister of Charity. Through all Madame d&rsquo;Argy&rsquo;s letters at this period
      the angelic figure of Giselle was contrasted with the very different one
      of that young and incorrigible little devil of a Jacqueline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred at first believed his mother&rsquo;s stories were all exaggeration, but the
      facts were there, corroborated by the continued silence of the person
      concerned. He knew his mother to be too good wilfully to blacken the
      character of one whom for years she had hoped would be her
      daughter-in-law, the only child of her best friend, the early love of her
      son. But by degrees he fancied that the love so long living at the bottom
      of his heart was slowly dying, that it had been extinguished, that nothing
      remained of it but remembrance, such remembrance as we retain for dead
      things, a remembrance without hope, whose weight added to the homesickness
      which with him was increasing every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no active service to enable him to endure exile. The heroic
      period of the war had passed. Since a treaty of peace had been signed with
      China, the fleet, which had distinguished itself in so many small
      engagements and bombardments, had had nothing to do but to mount guard, as
      it were, along a conquered coast. All round it in the bay, where it lay at
      anchor, rose mountains of strange shapes, which seemed to shut it into a
      kind of prison. This feeling of nothing to be done&mdash;of nothing likely
      to be done, worked in Fred&rsquo;s head like a nightmare. The only thing he
      thought of was how he could escape, when could he once more kiss the faded
      cheeks of his mother, who often, when he slept or lay wakeful during the
      long hours of the siesta, he saw beside him in tears. Hers was the only
      face that he recalled distinctly; to her and to her only were devoted his
      long reveries when on watch; that time when he formerly composed his love
      verses, tender or angry, or full of despair. That was all over! A sort of
      mournful resignation had succeeded his bursts of excited feeling, his
      revolt against his fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Fred&rsquo;s state of mind when he received orders to return home&mdash;orders
      as unexpected as everything seems to be in the life of a naval man. &ldquo;I am
      going back to her!&rdquo; he cried. Her was his mother, her was France. All the
      rest had disappeared as if into a fog. Jacqueline was a phantom of the
      past; so many things had happened since the old times when he had loved
      her. He had crossed the Indian Ocean and the China Sea; he had seen long
      stretches of interminable coast-line; he had beheld misery, and glory, and
      all the painful scenes that wait on warfare; he had seen pestilence, and
      death in every shape, and all this had wrought in him a sort of stoicism,
      the result of long acquaintance with solitude and danger. He remembered
      his old love as a flower he had once admired as he passed it, a
      treacherous flower, with thorns that had wounded him. There are flowers
      that are beneficent, and flowers that are poisonous, and the last are
      sometimes the most beautiful. They should not be blamed, he thought; it
      was their nature to be hurtful; but it was well to pass them by and not to
      gather them.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time he had debarked Fred had made up his mind to let his mother
      choose a wife for him, a daughter-in-law suited to herself, who would give
      her the delight of grandchildren, who would bring them up well, and who
      would not weary of Lizerolles. But a week later the idea of this kind of
      marriage had gone out of his head, and this change of feeling was partly
      owing to Giselle. Giselle gave him a smile of welcome that went to his
      heart, for that poor heart, after all, was only waiting for a chance again
      to give itself away. She was with Madame d&rsquo;Argy, who had not been well
      enough to go to the sea-coast to meet her son, and he saw at the same
      moment the pale and aged face which had visited him at Tonquin in his
      dreams, and a fair face that he had never before thought so beautiful,
      more oval than he remembered it, with blue eyes soft and tender, and a
      mouth with a sweet infantine expression of sincerity and goodness. His
      mother stretched out her trembling arms, gave a great cry, and fainted
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed; it is only joy,&rdquo; said Giselle, in her soft voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Madame d&rsquo;Argy proved her to be right by recovering very quickly,
      overwhelming her son with rapid questions and covering him with kisses,
      Giselle held out her hand to him and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, am very glad you have come home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried the sick woman in her excitement, &ldquo;you must kiss your old
      playfellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giselle blushed a little, and Fred, more embarrassed than she, lightly
      touched with his lips her pretty smooth hair which shone upon her head
      like a helmet of gold. Perhaps it was this new style of hairdressing which
      made her seem so much more beautiful than he remembered her, but it seemed
      to him he saw her for the first time; while, with the greatest eagerness,
      notwithstanding Giselle&rsquo;s attempts to interrupt her, Madame d&rsquo;Argy
      repeated to her son all she owed to that dear friend &ldquo;her own daughter,
      the best of daughters, the most patient, the most devoted of daughters,
      could not have done more! Ah! if there only could be found another one
      like her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon the object of all these praises made her escape, disclaiming
      everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, after this, should she have hesitated to come back to Lizerolles
      every day, as of late had been her custom? Men know so little about taking
      care of sick people. So she came, and was present at all the rejoicings
      and all the talks that followed Fred&rsquo;s return. She took her part in the
      discussions about Fred&rsquo;s future. &ldquo;Help me, my pet,&rdquo; said Madame d&rsquo;Argy,
      &ldquo;help me to find a wife for him: all we ask is that she should be like
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In answer to which Fred declared, half-laughing and half-seriously, that
      that was his ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not believe much of this, but, following her natural instinct, she
      assumed the dangerous task of consolation, until, as Madame d&rsquo;Argy grew
      better, she discontinued her daily visits, and Fred, in his turn, took a
      habit of going over to Fresne without being invited, and spending there a
      good deal of his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t send me away. You who are always charitable,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you only
      knew what a pleasure a Parisian conversation is after coming from
      Tonquin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am so little of a Parisienne, or at least what you mean by that
      term, and my conversation is not worth coming for,&rdquo; objected Giselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her extreme modesty she did not realize how much she had gained in
      intellectual culture. Women left to themselves have time to read, and
      Giselle had done this all the more because she had considered it a duty.
      Must she not know enough to instruct and superintend the education of her
      son? With much strong feeling, yet with much simplicity, she spoke to Fred
      of this great task, which sometimes frightened her; he gave her his
      advice, and both discussed together the things that make up a good man.
      Giselle brought up frequently the subject of heredity: she named no one,
      but Fred could see that she had a secret terror lest Enguerrand, who in
      person was very like his father, might also inherit his character. Fears
      on this subject, however, appeared unfounded. There was nothing about the
      child that was not good; his tastes were those of his mother. He was
      passionately fond of Fred, climbing on his lap as soon as the latter
      arrived and always maintaining that he, too, wanted a pretty red ribbon to
      wear in his buttonhole, a ribbon only to be got by sailing far away over
      the seas, like sailors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sailor! Heaven forbid!&rdquo; cried Madame de Talbrun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sailors come back again. He has come back. Couldn&rsquo;t he take me away
      with him soon? I have some stories about cabin-boys who were not much
      older than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hope that your friend Fred won&rsquo;t go away,&rdquo; said Giselle. &ldquo;But why
      do you wish to be a cabinboy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I want to go away with him, if he does not stay here&mdash;because
      I like him,&rdquo; answered Enguerrand in a tone of decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon Giselle kissed her boy with more than usual tenderness. He would
      not take to the hunting-field, she thought, the boulevard, and the corps
      de ballet. She would not lose him. &ldquo;But, oh, Fred!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;it is not
      to be wondered at that he is so fond of you! You spoil him! You will be a
      devoted father some day; your vocation is evidently for marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thought, in thus speaking, that she was saying what Madame d&rsquo;Argy
      would like her to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the matter of children, I think your son is enough for me,&rdquo; he said,
      one day; &ldquo;and as for marriage, you would not believe how all women&mdash;I
      mean all the young girls among whom I should have to make a choice&mdash;are
      indifferent to me. My feeling almost amounts to antipathy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time she ventured to say: &ldquo;Do you still care for
      Jacqueline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About as much as she cares for me,&rdquo; he answered, dryly. &ldquo;No, I made a
      mistake once, and that has made me cautious for the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another day he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know now who was the woman I ought to have loved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giselle did not look up; she was devoting all her attention to Enguerrand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred held certain theories which he used to talk about. He believed in a
      high, spiritual, disinterested affection which would raise a man above
      himself, making him more noble, inspiring a disgust for all ignoble
      pleasures. The woman willing to accept such homage might do anything she
      pleased with a heart that would be hers alone. She would be the lady who
      presided over his life, for whose sake all good deeds and generous actions
      would be done, the idol, higher than a wife or any object of earthly
      passion, the White Angel whom poets have sung.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giselle pretended that she did not understand him, but she was divinely
      happy. This, then, was the reward of her spotless life! She was the object
      of a worship no less tender than respectful. Fred spoke of the woman he
      ought to have loved as if he meant to say, &ldquo;I love you;&rdquo; he pressed his
      lips on the auburn curls of little Enguerrand where his mother had just
      kissed him. Day after day he seemed more attracted to that salon where,
      dressed with more care than she had ever dressed before, she expected him.
      Then awoke in her the wish to please, and she was beautiful with that
      beauty which is not the insipid beauty of St. Agnes, but that which,
      superior to all other, is seen when the face reflects the soul. All that
      winter there was a new Giselle&mdash;a Giselle who passed away again among
      the shadows, a Giselle of whom everybody said, even her husband, &ldquo;Ma foi!
      but she is beautiful!&rdquo; Oscar de Talbrun, as he made this remark, never
      thought of wondering why she was more beautiful. He was ready to take
      offense and was jealous by nature, but he was perfectly sure of his wife,
      as he had often said. As to Fred, the idea of being jealous of him would
      never have entered his mind. Fred was a relative and was admitted to all
      the privileges of a cousin or a brother; besides, he was a fellow of no
      consequence in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this platonic attachment grew stronger and stronger between Fred and
      Giselle, assisted by the innocent complicity of little Enguerrand,
      Jacqueline was discovering how hard it is for a girl of good birth, if she
      is poor, to carry out her plans of honest independence. Possibly she had
      allowed herself to be too easily misled by the title of &ldquo;companion,&rdquo;
       which, apparently more cordial than that of &lsquo;demoiselle de compagnie&rsquo;,
      means in reality the same thing&mdash;a sort of half-servile position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Money is a touchstone which influences all social relations, especially
      when on one side there is a somewhat morbid susceptibility, and on the
      other a lack of good breeding and education. The Sparks, father and
      daughter, Americans of the lower class, though willing to spend any number
      of dollars for their own pleasure, expected that every penny they
      disbursed should receive its full equivalent in service; the place
      therefore offered so gracefully and spontaneously to Mademoiselle de
      Nailles was far from being a sinecure. Jacqueline received her salary on
      the same footing as Justine, the Parisian maid, received her wages, for,
      although her position was apparently one of much greater importance and
      consideration than Justine&rsquo;s, she was really at the beck and call of a
      girl who, while she called her &ldquo;darling,&rdquo; gave her orders and paid her for
      her services. Very often Miss Nora asked her to sew, on the plea that she
      was as skilful with her fingers as a fairy, but in reality that her
      employer might feel the superiority of her own position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto Miss Nora had been delighted to meet at watering-places a friend
      of whom she could say proudly, &ldquo;She is a representative of the old
      nobility of France&rdquo; (which was not true, by the way, for the title of
      Baron borne by M. de Nailles went no farther back than the days of Louis
      XVIII); and she was still more proud to think that she was now waited on
      by this same daughter of a nobleman, when her own father had kept a
      drinking-saloon. She did not acknowledge this feeling to herself, and
      would certainly have maintained that she never had had such an idea, but
      it existed all the same, and she was under its influence, being very vain
      and rather foolish. And, indeed, Jacqueline, would have been very willing
      to plan trimmings and alter finery from morning to night in her own
      chamber in a hotel, exactly as Mademoiselle Justine did, if she could by
      this means have escaped the special duties of her difficult position,
      which duties were to follow Miss Nora everywhere, like her own shadow, to
      be her confidant and to act sometimes as her screen, or even as her
      accomplice, in matters that occasionally involved risks, and were never to
      her liking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young American girl had already said to her father, when he asked her
      to give up her search for an entirely satisfactory European suitor, which
      search he feared might drag on forever without any results: &ldquo;Oh! I shall
      be sure to find him at Bellagio!&rdquo; And she made up her mind that there he
      was to be sought and found at any price. Hotel life offered her
      opportunities to exercise her instincts for flirtation, for there she met
      many specimens of men she called chic, with a funny little foreign accent,
      which seemed to put new life into the wornout word. Twenty times a day she
      baited her hook, and twenty times a day some fish would bite, or at least
      nibble, according as he was a fortune-hunter or a dilettante. Miss Nora,
      being incapable of knowing the difference, was ready to capture good or
      bad, and went about dragging her slaves at her chariot-wheels. Sometimes
      she took them rowing, with the Stars and Stripes floating over her boat,
      by moonlight; sometimes she drove them recklessly in a drag through roads
      bordered by olive-groves and vineyards; all these expeditions being
      undertaken under-pretence of admiring the romantic scenery. Her father was
      not disposed to interfere with what he called &ldquo;a little harmless
      dissipation.&rdquo; He was confident his daughter&rsquo;s &ldquo;companion&rdquo; must know what
      was proper, she being, as he said, accustomed to good society. Were not
      all Italian ladies attended by gentlemen? Who could blame a young girl for
      amusing herself? Meantime Mr. Sparks amused himself after his own fashion,
      which was to sit comfortably, with his feet up on the piazza rail of the
      hotel, imbibing strong iced drinks through straws. But in reality
      Jacqueline had no power whatever to preserve propriety, and only
      compromised herself by her associations, though her own conduct was
      irreproachable. Indeed she was considered quite prudish, and the rest of
      the mad crowd laughed at her for having the manners of a governess. In
      vain she tried to say words of warning to Nora; what she said was laughed
      at or resented in a tone that told her that a paid companion had not the
      right to speak as frankly as a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her business, she was plainly told one day, was to be on the spot in case
      any impertinent suitor should venture too far in a tete-a-tete, but short
      of that she was not to &ldquo;spoilsport.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am not doing anything wrong; it is
      allowable in America,&rdquo; was Miss Nora&rsquo;s regular speech on such occasions,
      and Jacqueline could not dispute the double argument. Nora&rsquo;s conduct was
      not wicked, and in America such things might be allowed. Yet Jacqueline
      tried to demonstrate that a young girl can not pass unscathed through
      certain adventures, even if they are innocent in the strict sense of the
      word; which made Nora cry out that all she said was subterfuge and that
      she had no patience with prejudices.
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain her young companion pointed out to her charge that other Americans
      at Bellagio seemed far from approving her conduct. American ladies of a
      very different class, who were staying at the hotel, held aloof from her,
      and treated her with marked coldness whenever they met; declaring that her
      manners would be as objectionable in her own country, in good society, as
      they were in Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Sparks was not to be put down by any argument. &ldquo;Bah! they are
      stuck-up Bostonians. And do you know, Jacqueline, you are getting very
      tiresome? You were faster yourself than I when we were the Blue Band at
      Treport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nora&rsquo;s admirers, sometimes encouraged, sometimes snubbed, when treated
      cavalierly by this young lady, would occasionally pay court to the
      &lsquo;demoiselle de compagnie&rsquo;, who indeed was well worth their pains; but, to
      their surprise, the subordinate received their attentions with great
      coldness. Having entered her protest against what was going on, and having
      resisted the contagion of example, it was natural she should somewhat
      exaggerate her prudery, for it is hard to hit just the right point in such
      reaction. The result was, she made herself so disagreeable to Miss Sparks
      that the latter determined on getting rid of her as tactfully as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their parting took place on the day after an excursion to the Villa
      Sommariva, where Miss Sparks and her little court had behaved with their
      usual noise and rudeness. They had gone there ostensibly to see the
      pictures, about which none of them cared anything, for Nora, wherever she
      was, never liked any one to pay attention to anybody or to look at
      anything but her own noisy, all-pervading self.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened that at the most riotous moment of the picnic an old
      gentleman passed near the lively crowd. He was quite inoffensive,
      pleasant-mannered, and walked leaning on his cane, yet, had the statue of
      the Commander in Don Juan suddenly appeared it could not have produced
      such consternation as his presence did on Jacqueline, when, after a
      moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he bowed to her. She recognized in him a friend of
      Madame d&rsquo;Argy, M. Martel, whom she had often met at her house in Paris and
      at Lizerolles. When he recognized her, she fancied she had seen pass over
      his face a look of painful surprise. He would surely tell how he had met
      her; what would her old friends think of her? What would Fred? For some
      time past she had thought more than ever before of what Fred would think
      of her. The more she grew disgusted with the men she met, the more she
      appreciated his good qualities, and the more she thought of the honest,
      faithful love he had offered her&mdash;love that she had so madly thrown
      away. She never should meet such love again, she thought. It was the idea
      of how Fred would blame her when he heard what she pictured to herself the
      old gentleman would say of her, that suddenly decided her to leave
      Bellagio.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told Mr. Sparks that evening that she was not strong enough for such
      duties as were required of a companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with pity and annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought you had more energy. How do you expect to live by
      work if you are not strong enough for pleasure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleasure needs strength as well as labor,&rdquo; she said, smiling; &ldquo;I would
      rather work in the fields than go on amusing myself as I have been doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you must not be so difficult to please. When people have to earn
      their bread, it is a bad plan. I am afraid you will find out before long
      that there are harder ways of making a living than lunching, dancing,
      walking, and driving from morning to night in a pretty country&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr. Sparks began to laugh as he thought of all he had had to do,
      without making objections, in the Far West, in the heroic days of his
      youthful vigor. He was rather fond of recalling how he had carried his
      pick on his shoulder and his knife in his belt, with two Yankee sayings in
      his head, and little besides for baggage: &ldquo;Muscle and pluck!&mdash;Muscle
      and pluck!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Go ahead for ever!&rdquo; That was the sort of thing to be done
      when a man or a woman had not a cent.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, what was Jacqueline to do next? She reflected that in a very
      short time she had attempted many things. It seemed to her that all she
      could do now was to follow the advice which, when first given her by
      Madame Strahlberg, had frightened her, though she had found it so
      attractive. She would study with Madame Rochette; she would go to the
      Milan Conservatory, and as soon as she came of age she would go upon the
      stage, under a feigned name, of course, and in a foreign country. She
      would prove to the world, she said to herself, that the career of an
      actress is compatible with self-respect. This resolve that she would never
      be found wanting in self-respect held a prominent place in all her plans,
      as she began to understand better those dangers in life which are for the
      most part unknown to young girls born in her social position. Jacqueline&rsquo;s
      character, far from being injured by her trials and experiences, had
      gained in strength. She grew firmer as she gained in knowledge. Never had
      she been so worthy of regard and interest as at the very time when her
      friends were saying sadly to themselves, &ldquo;She is going to the bad,&rdquo; and
      when, from all appearances, they were right in this conclusion.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. TWIN DEVILS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jacqueline came to the conclusion that she had better seriously consult
      Madame Strahlberg. She therefore stopped at Monaco, where this friend,
      whom she intended to honor with the strange office of Mentor, was passing
      the winter in a little villa in the Condamine quarter&mdash;a cottage
      surrounded by roses and laurel-bushes, painted in soft colors and looking
      like a plaything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Strahlberg had already urged Jacqueline to come and make
      acquaintance with her &ldquo;paradise,&rdquo; without giving her any hint of the
      delights of that paradise, from which that of gambling was not excluded,
      for Madame Strahlberg was eager for any kind of excitement. Roulette now
      occupied with her a large part of every night&mdash;indeed, her nights had
      been rarely given to slumber, for her creed was that morning is the time
      for sleep, for which reason they never took breakfast in the pink villa,
      but tea, cakes, and confectionery were eaten instead at all hours until
      the evening. Thus it happened very often that they had no dinner, and
      guests had to accommodate themselves to the strange ways of the family.
      Jacqueline, however, did not stay long enough to know much of those ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      She arrived, poor thing, with weary wing, like some bird, who, escaping
      from the fowler&rsquo;s net, where it has left its feathers, flies straight to
      the spot where a sportsman lies ready to shoot it. She was received with
      the same cries of joy, the same kisses, the same demonstrations of
      affection, as those which, the summer before, had welcomed her to the Rue
      de Naples. They told her she could sleep on a sofa, exactly like the one
      on which she had passed that terrible night which had resulted in her
      expulsion from the convent; and it was decided that she must stay several
      days, at least, before she went on to Paris, to begin the life of hard
      study and courageous work which would make of her a great singer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tired?&mdash;No, she was hardly tired at all. The journey over the
      enchanting road of the Corniche had awakened in her a fervor of admiration
      which prevented her from feeling any bodily needs, and now she seemed to
      have reached fairyland, where the verdure of the tropics was like the
      hanging gardens of Babylon, only those had never had a mirror to reflect
      back their ancient, far-famed splendor, like that before her eyes, as she
      looked down upon the Mediterranean, with the sun setting in the west in a
      sky all crimson and gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the disorder of her travelling-dress, Jacqueline allowed
      her friend to take her straight from the railway station to the Terrace of
      Monte Carlo. She fell into ecstasies at sight of the African cacti, the
      century plants, and the fig-trees of Barbary, covering the low walls
      whence they looked down into the water; at the fragrance of the evergreens
      that surrounded the beautiful palace with its balustrades, dedicated to
      all the worst passions of the human race; with the sharp rocky outline of
      Turbia; with an almost invisible speck on the horizon which they said was
      Corsica; with everything, which, whether mirage or reality, lifted her out
      of herself, and plunged her into that state of excited happiness and
      indescribable sense of bodily comfort, which exterior impressions so
      easily produce upon the young.
    </p>
    <p>
      After exhausting her vocabulary in exclamations and in questions, she
      stood silent, watching the sun as it sank beneath the waters, thinking
      that life is well worth living if it can give us such glorious spectacles,
      notwithstanding all the difficulties that may have to be passed through.
      Several minutes elapsed before she turned her radiant face and dazzled
      eyes toward Wanda, or rather toward the spot where Wanda had been standing
      beside her. &ldquo;Oh! my dear&mdash;how beautiful!&rdquo; she murmured with a long
      sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sigh was echoed by a man, who for a few moments had looked at her with
      as much admiration as she had looked at the landscape. He answered her by
      saying, in a low voice, the tones of which made her tremble from head to
      foot:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacqueline!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de Cymier!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words slipped through her lips as they suddenly turned pale. She had
      an instinctive, sudden persuasion that she had been led into a snare. If
      not, why was Madame Strahlberg now absorbed in conversation with three
      other persons at some little distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me&mdash;you did not expect to see me&mdash;you seem quite
      startled,&rdquo; said the young man, drawing near her. With an effort she
      commanded herself and looked full in his face. Her anger rose. She had
      seen the same look in the ugly, brutal face of Oscar de Talbrun. From the
      Terrace of Monte Carlo her memory flew back to a country road in Normandy,
      and she clenched her hand round an imaginary riding-whip. She needed
      coolness and she needed courage. They came as if by miracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is certain, Monsieur,&rdquo; she answered, slowly, &ldquo;that I did not expect to
      meet you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chance has had pity on me,&rdquo; he replied, bowing low, as she had set him
      the example of ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had no idea of losing time in commonplace remarks&mdash;he wished
      to take up their intimacy on the terms it had been formerly, to resume the
      romance he himself had interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew,&rdquo; he said in the same low voice, full of persuasion, which gave
      especial meaning to his words, &ldquo;I knew that, after all, we should meet
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not expect it,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you do not believe in the magnetism of a fixed desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not believe any such thing, when, opposed to such a desire,
      there is a strong, firm will,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, her eyes burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he murmured, and he might have been supposed to be really moved, so
      much his look changed, &ldquo;do not abuse your power over me&mdash;do not make
      me wretched; if you could only understand&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made a swift movement to rejoin Madame Strahlberg, but that lady was
      already coming toward them with the same careless ease with which she had
      left them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! you have each found an old acquaintance,&rdquo; she said, gayly. &ldquo;I beg
      your pardon, my loveliest, but I had to speak to some old friends, and ask
      them to join us to-morrow evening. We shall sup at the restaurant of the
      Grand Hotel, after the opera&mdash;for, I did not tell you before, you
      will have the good luck to hear Patti. Monsieur de Cymier, we shall expect
      you. Au revoir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had been on the point of asking leave to walk home with them. But there
      was something in Jacqueline&rsquo;s look, and in her stubborn silence, that
      deterred him. He thought it best to leave a skilful advocate to plead his
      cause before he continued a conversation which had not begun
      satisfactorily. Not that Gerard de Cymier was discouraged by the behavior
      of Jacqueline. He had expected her to be angry at his defection, and that
      she would make him pay for it; but a little skill on his part, and a
      little credulity on hers, backed by the intervention of a third party,
      might set things right.
    </p>
    <p>
      One moment he lingered to look at her, admiring her as she stood in the
      light of the dying sun, as beautiful in her plain dress and her indignant
      paleness, while she looked far out to sea, that she might not be obliged
      to look at him, as she had been when he had known her in prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment he knew she hated him, but it would be an additional
      delight to overcome that feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women, when he left them, continued walking on the terrace side by
      side, without a word. Wanda watched her companion out of the corners of
      her eyes, and hummed an air to herself to break the silence. She saw a
      storm gathering under Jacqueline&rsquo;s black eyebrows, and knew that sharp
      arrows were likely to shoot forth from those lips which several times had
      opened, though not a word had been uttered, probably through fear of
      saying too little or too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she made some trifling comment on the view, explaining something
      about pigeon-shooting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wanda,&rdquo; interrupted Jacqueline, &ldquo;did you not know what happened once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happened, how? About what?&rdquo; asked Madame Strahlberg, with an air of
      innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am speaking of the way Monsieur de Cymier treated me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! He was in love with you. Who didn&rsquo;t know it? Every one could see
      that. It was all the more reason why you should have been glad to meet
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not act as if he were much in love,&rdquo; said Jacqueline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he went away when your family thought he was about to make his
      formal proposal? Not all men are marrying men, my dear, nor have all women
      that vocation. Men fall in love all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think, then, that when a man knows he has no intention of marrying
      he should pay court to a young girl? I think I told you at the time that
      he had paid court to me, and that he afterward&mdash;how shall I say it?&mdash;basely
      deserted me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sharp and thrilling tone in which Jacqueline said this amused Madame
      Strahlberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What big words, my dear! No, I don&rsquo;t remember that you ever said anything
      of the sort to me before. But you are wrong. As we grow older we lay aside
      harsh judgments and sharp words. They do no good. In your place I should
      be touched by the thought that a man so charming had been faithful to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faithful!&rdquo; cried Jacqueline, her dark eyes flashing into the cat-like
      eyes of Madame Strahlberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wanda looked down, and fastened a ribbon at her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever since we have been here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he has been talking of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really&mdash;for how long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if you must know, for the last two weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is just a fortnight since you wrote and asked me to stay with you,&rdquo;
       said Jacqueline, coldly and reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well&mdash;what&rsquo;s the harm? Suppose I did think your presence would
      increase the attractions of Monaco?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you not tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I never write a word more than is necessary; you know how lazy I
      am. And also because, I may as well confess, it might have scared you off,
      you are so sensitive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you meant to take me by surprise?&rdquo; said Jacqueline, in the same
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear, why do you try to quarrel with me?&rdquo; replied Madame
      Strahlberg, stopping suddenly and looking at her through her eyeglass. &ldquo;We
      may as well understand what you mean by a free and independent life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thereupon ensued an address to which Jacqueline listened, leaning one
      hand on a balustrade of that enchanted garden, while the voice of the
      serpent, as she thought, was ringing in her ears. Her limbs shook under
      her&mdash;her brain reeled. All her hopes of success as a singer on the
      stage Madame Strahlberg swept away, as not worth a thought. She told her
      that, in her position, had she meant to be too scrupulous, she should have
      stayed in the convent. Everything to Jacqueline seemed to dance before her
      eyes. The evening closed around them, the light died out, the landscape,
      like her life, had lost its glow. She uttered a brief prayer for help,
      such a prayer as she had prayed in infancy. She whispered it in terror,
      like a cry in extreme danger. She was more frightened by Wanda&rsquo;s wicked
      words than she had been by M. de Talbrun or by M. de Cymier. She ceased to
      know what she was saying till the last words, &ldquo;You have good sense and you
      will think about it,&rdquo; met her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline said not a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wanda took her arm. &ldquo;You may be sure,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I am thinking only
      of your good. Come! Would you like to go into the Casino and look at the
      pictures? No, you are tired? You can see them some evening. The ballroom
      holds a thousand persons. Yes, if you prefer, we will go home. You can
      take a nap till dinner-time. We shall dine at eight o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Conversation languished till they reached the Villa Rosa. Notwithstanding
      Jacqueline&rsquo;s efforts to appear natural, her own voice rang in her ears in
      tones quite new to her, a laugh that she uttered without any occasion, and
      which came near resulting in hysterics. Yet she had power enough over her
      nerves to notice the surroundings as she entered the house. At the door of
      the room in which she was to sleep, and which was on the first story,
      Madame Strahlberg kissed her with one of those equivocal smiles which so
      long had imposed on her simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till eight o&rsquo;clock, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till eight o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; repeated Jacqueline, passively.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when eight o&rsquo;clock came she sent word that she had a severe headache,
      and would try to sleep it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose, she thought, M. de Cymier should have been asked to dinner;
      suppose she should be placed next to him at table? Anything in that house
      seemed possible now.
    </p>
    <p>
      They brought her a cup of tea. Up to a late hour she heard a confused
      noise of music and laughter. She did not try to sleep. All her faculties
      were on the alert, like those of a prisoner who is thinking of escape. She
      knew what time the night trains left the station, and, abandoning her
      trunk and everything else that she had with her, she furtively&mdash;but
      ready, if need were, to fight for her liberty with the strength of
      desperation&mdash;slipped down the broad stairs over their thick carpet
      and pushed open a little glass door. Thank heaven! people came in and went
      out of that house as if it had been a mill. No one discovered her flight
      till the next morning, when she was far on her way to Paris in an express
      train. Modeste, quite unprepared for her young mistress&rsquo;s arrival, was
      amazed to see her drop down upon her, feverish and excited, like some poor
      hunted animal, with strength exhausted. Jacqueline flung herself into her
      nurse&rsquo;s arms as she used to do when, as a little girl, she was in what she
      fancied some great trouble, and she cried: &ldquo;Oh, take me in&mdash;pray take
      me in! Keep me safe! Hide me!&rdquo; And then she told Modeste everything,
      speaking rapidly and disconnectedly, thankful to have some one to whom she
      could open her heart. In default of Modeste she would have spoken to stone
      walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what will you do now, my poor darling?&rdquo; asked the old nurse, as soon
      as she understood that her young lady had come back to her, &ldquo;with weary
      foot and broken wing,&rdquo; from what she had assured her on her departure
      would be a brilliant excursion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Jacqueline, in utter discouragement; &ldquo;I am
      too worn out to think or to do anything. Let me rest; that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go to see your stepmother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My stepmother? Oh, no! She is at the bottom of all that has happened to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or Madame d&rsquo;Argy? Or Madame de Talbrun? Madame de Talbrun is the one who
      would give you good advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline shook her head with a sad smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me stay here. Don&rsquo;t you remember&mdash;years ago&mdash;but it seems
      like yesterday&mdash;all the rest is like a nightmare&mdash;how I used to
      hide myself under your petticoats, and you would say, going on with your
      knitting: &lsquo;You see she is not here; I can&rsquo;t think where she can be.&rsquo; Hide
      me now just like that, dear old Modeste. Only hide me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Modeste, full of heartfelt pity, promised to hide her &ldquo;dear child&rdquo;
       from every one, which promise, however, did not prevent her, for she was
      very self-willed, from going, without Jacqueline&rsquo;s knowledge, to see
      Madame de Talbrun and tell her all that had taken place. She was hurt and
      amazed at her reception by Giselle, and at her saying, without any offer
      of help or words of sympathy, &ldquo;She has only reaped what she has sown.&rdquo;
       Giselle would have been more than woman had not Fred, and a remembrance of
      the wrongs that he had suffered through Jacqueline, now stood between
      them. For months he had been the prime object in her life; her mission of
      comforter had brought her the greatest happiness she had ever known. She
      tried to make him turn his attention to some serious work in life; she
      wanted to keep him at home, for his mother&rsquo;s sake, she thought; she
      fancied she had inspired him with a taste for home life. If she had
      examined herself she might have discovered that the task she had
      undertaken of doing good to this young man was not wholly for his sake but
      partly for her own. She wanted to see him nearly every day and to occupy a
      place in his life ever larger and larger. But for some time past the
      conscientious Giselle had neglected the duty of strict self-examination.
      She was thankful to be happy&mdash;and though Fred was a man little given
      to self-flattery in his relations with women, he could not but be pleased
      at the change produced in her by her intercourse with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while Fred and Giselle considered themselves as two friends trying to
      console each other, people had begun to talk about them. Even Madame
      d&rsquo;Argy asked herself whether her son might not have escaped from the cruel
      claws of a young coquette of the new school to fall into a worse scrape
      with a married woman. She imagined what might happen if the jealousy of
      &ldquo;that wild boar of an Oscar de Talbrun&rdquo; were aroused; the dangers, far
      more terrible than the perils of the sea, that might in such a case await
      her only son, the child for whose safety her mother-love caused her to
      suffer perpetual torments. &ldquo;O mothers! mothers!&rdquo; she often said to
      herself, &ldquo;how much they are to be pitied. And they are very blind. If Fred
      must get into danger and difficulty for any woman, it should not have been
      for Giselle de Talbrun.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII. &ldquo;AN AFFAIR OF HONOR&rdquo;
     </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   A meeting took place yesterday at Vesinet between the Vicomte de
   Cymier, secretary of Embassy at Vienna, and M. Frederic d&rsquo;Argy,
   ensign in the navy. The parties fought with swords. The seconds of
   M. de Cymier were the Prince de Moelk and M. d&rsquo;Etaples, captain in
   the&mdash;th Hussars; those of M. d&rsquo;Argy Hubert Marien, the painter.
   M. d&rsquo;Argy was wounded in the right arm, and for the present the
   affair is terminated, but it is said it will be resumed on M.
   d&rsquo;Argy&rsquo;s recovery, although this seems hardly probable, considering
   the very slight cause of the quarrel&mdash;an altercation at the Cercle
   de la Rue Boissy d&rsquo;Anglas, which took place over the card-table.
</pre>
    <p>
      Such was the announcement in a daily paper that met the eyes of
      Jacqueline, as she lay hidden in Modeste&rsquo;s lodging, like a fawn in its
      covert, her eyes and ears on the alert, watching for the least sign of
      alarm, in fear and trembling. She expected something, she knew not what;
      she felt that her sad adventure at Monaco could not fail to have its
      epilogue; but this was one of which she never had dreamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Modeste, give me my hat! Get me a carriage! Quick! Oh, my God, it is my
      fault!&mdash;I have killed him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These incoherent cries came from her lips while Modeste, in alarm, picked
      up the newspaper and adjusted her silver spectacles upon her nose to read
      the paragraph. &ldquo;Monsieur Fred wounded! Holy Virgin! His poor mother! That
      is a new trouble fallen on her, to be sure. But this quarrel had nothing
      to do with you, my pet; you see they say it was about cards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And folding up the Figaro, while Jacqueline in all haste was wrapping her
      head in a veil, Modeste, with the best intentions, went on to say: &ldquo;Nobody
      ever dies of a sword-thrust in the arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you see it says that they are going to fight all over again&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you understand? You are so stupid! What could they have had to quarrel
      about but me? O God! Thou art just! This is indeed punishment&mdash;too
      much punishment for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she ran down the many stairs that led up to Modeste&rsquo;s little
      lodging in the roof, her feet hardly touching them as she ran, while
      Modeste followed her more slowly, crying: &ldquo;Wait for me! Wait for me,
      Mademoiselle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Calling a fiacre, Jacqueline, almost roughly, pushed the old woman into
      it, and gave the coachman the address of Madame d&rsquo;Argy, having, in her
      excitement, first given him that of their old house in the Parc Monceau,
      so much was she possessed by the idea that this was a repetition of that
      dreadful day, when with Modeste, just as now, she went to meet an
      irreparable loss. She seemed to see before her her dead father&mdash;he
      looked like Fred, and now, as before, Marien had his part in the tragedy.
      Could he not have prevented the duel? Could he not have done something to
      prevent Fred from exposing himself? The wound might be no worse than it
      was said to be in the newspaper&mdash;but then a second meeting was to
      take place. No!&mdash;it should not, she would stop it at any price!
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, as the coach drew nearer to the Rue de Varenne, where Madame
      d&rsquo;Argy had her winter residence, a little calm, a little sense returned to
      Jacqueline. She did not see how she could dare to enter that house, where
      probably they cursed her very name. She would wait in the street with the
      carriage-blinds pulled down, and Modeste should go in and ask for
      information. Five minutes passed&mdash;ten minutes passed&mdash;they
      seemed ages. How slow Modeste was, slow as a tortoise! How could she leave
      her there when she knew she was so anxious? What could she be doing? All
      she had to do was to ask news of M. Fred in just two words!
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, Jacqueline could bear suspense no longer. She opened the
      coach-door and jumped out on the pavement. Just at that moment Modeste
      appeared, brandishing the umbrella that she carried instead of a stick, in
      a manner that meant something. It might be bad news, she would know in a
      moment; anything was better than suspense. She sprang forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did they say, Modeste? Speak!&mdash;Why have you been such a time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the servants had something else to do than to attend to me. I
      wasn&rsquo;t the only person there&mdash;they were writing in a register. Get
      back into the carriage, Mademoiselle, or somebody will see you&mdash;There
      are lots of people there who know you&mdash;Monsieur and Madame d&rsquo;Etaples&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I care?&mdash;The truth! Tell me the truth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t you understand my signals? He is going on well. It was only a
      scratch&mdash;Ah! Madame that&rsquo;s only my way of talking. He will be laid up
      for a fortnight. The doctor was there&mdash;he has some fever, but he is
      not in any danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what a blessing! Kiss me, Modeste. We have a fortnight in which we
      may interfere&mdash;But how&mdash;Oh, how?&mdash;Ah! there is Giselle! We
      will go to Giselle at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the &lsquo;fiacre&rsquo; was ordered to go as fast as possible to the Rue
      Barbet-de-Jouy. This time Jacqueline herself spoke to the concierge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame la Comtesse is out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she never goes out at this hour. I wish to see her on important
      business. I must see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Jacqueline passed the concierge, only to encounter another refusal
      from a footman, who insisted that Madame la Comtesse was at home to no
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But me, she will see me. Go and tell her it is Mademoiselle de Nailles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moved by her persistence, the footman went in to inquire, and came back
      immediately with the answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame la Comtesse can not see Mademoiselle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; thought Jacqueline, &ldquo;she, too, throws me off, and it is natural. I
      have no friends left. No one will tell me anything!&mdash;I think it will
      drive me mad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was half-mad already. She stopped at a newsstand and bought all the
      evening journals; then, up in her garret, in her poor little nest under
      the roof-which, as she felt bitterly, was her only refuge, she began to
      look over those printed papers in which she might possibly find out the
      true cause of the duel. Nearly all related the event in almost the exact
      terms used by the Figaro. Ah!&mdash;here was a different one! A reporter
      who knew something more added, in Gil Blas: &ldquo;We have stated the cause of
      the dispute as it has been given to the public, but in affairs of this
      nature more than in any others, it is safe to remember the old proverb:
      &lsquo;Look for the woman.&rsquo; The woman could doubtless have been found enjoying
      herself on the sunny shores of the Mediterranean, while men were drawing
      swords in her defense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline went on looking through the newspapers, crumpling up the sheets
      as she laid them down. The last she opened had the reputation of being a
      repository of scandals, never to be depended on, as she well knew. Several
      times it had come to her hand and she had not opened it, remembering what
      her father had always said of its reputation. But where would she be more
      likely to find what she wanted than in the columns of a journal whose
      reporters listened behind doors and peeped through keyholes? Under the
      heading of &lsquo;Les Dessous Parisiens&rsquo;, she read on the first page:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;Two hens lived in peace; a cock came
        And strife soon succeeded to joy;
        E&rsquo;en as love, they say, kindled the flame
        That destroyed the proud city of Troy.

   &ldquo;This quarrel was the outcome of a violent rupture between the two
   hens in question, ending in the flight of one of them, a young and
   tender pullet, whose voice we trust soon to hear warbling on the
   boards at one of our theatres. This was the subject of conversation
   in a low voice at the Cercle, at the hour when it is customary to
   tell such little scandals. M. de C&mdash;&mdash;-was enlarging on the
   somewhat Bohemian character of the establishment of a lovely foreign
   lady, who possesses the secret of being always surrounded by
   delightful friends, young ladies who are self-emancipated, quasi-
   widows who, by divorce suits, have regained their liberty, etc.
   He was speaking of one of the beauties who are friends of his friend
   Madame S&mdash;&mdash;, as men speak of women who have proved themselves
   careless of public opinion; when M. d&rsquo;A&mdash;&mdash;, in a loud voice,
   interrupted him; the lie was given in terms that of course led to
   the hostile meeting of which the press has spoken, attributing it to
   a dispute about the Queen of Spades, when it really concerned the
   Queen of Hearts.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then she had made no mistake; it had been her flight from Madame
      Strahlberg&rsquo;s which had led to her being attacked by one man, and defended
      by the other! Jacqueline found it hard to recognize herself in this tissue
      of lies, insinuations, and half-truths. What did the paper mean its
      readers to understand by its account? Was it a jealous rivalry between
      herself and Madame Strahlberg?&mdash;Was M. de Cymier meant by the cock?
      And Fred had heard all this&mdash;he had drawn his sword to refute the
      calumny. Brave Fred! Alas! he had been prompted only by chivalric
      generosity. Doubtless he, also, looked upon her as an adventuress.
    </p>
    <p>
      All night poor Jacqueline wept with such distress that she wished that she
      might die. She was dropping off to sleep at last, overpowered by fatigue,
      when a ring at the bell in the early morning roused her. Then she heard
      whispering:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think she is so unhappy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the voice of Giselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in&mdash;come in quickly!&rdquo; she cried, springing out of bed. Wrapped
      in a dressing-gown, with bare feet, her face pale, her eyelids red, her
      complexion clouded, she rushed to meet her friend, who was almost as much
      disordered as herself. It seemed as if Madame de Talbrun might also have
      passed a night of sleeplessness and tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come! Oh! you have come at last!&rdquo; cried Jacqueline, throwing her
      arms around her, but Giselle repelled her with a gesture so severe that
      the poor child could not but understand its meaning. She murmured,
      pointing to the pile of newspapers: &ldquo;Is it possible?&mdash;Can you have
      believed all those dreadful things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What things? I have read nothing,&rdquo; said Giselle, harshly. &ldquo;I only know
      that a man who was neither your husband nor your brother, and who
      consequently was under no obligation to defend you, has been foolish
      enough to be nearly killed for your sake. Is not that a proof of your
      downfall? Don&rsquo;t you know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Downfall?&rdquo; repeated Jacqueline, as if she did not understand her. Then,
      seizing her friend&rsquo;s hand, she forcibly raised it to her lips: &ldquo;Ah! what
      can anything matter to me,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;if only you remain my friend; and
      he has never doubted me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women like you can always find defenders,&rdquo; said Giselle, tearing her hand
      from her cousin&rsquo;s grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giselle was not herself at that moment. &ldquo;But, for your own sake, it would
      have been better he should have abstained from such an act of Quixotism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Giselle! can it be that you think me guilty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guilty!&rdquo; cried Madame de Talbrun, her pale face aflame. &ldquo;A little more
      and Monsieur de Cymier&rsquo;s sword-point would have pierced his lungs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; cried Jacqueline, hiding her face in her hands. &ldquo;But I
      have done nothing to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing except to set two men against each other; to make them suffer, or
      to make fools of them, and to be loved by them all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not been a coquette,&rdquo; said Jacqueline, with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have been, to authorize the boasts of Monsieur de Cymier. He had
      seen Fred so seldom, and Tonquin had so changed him that he spoke in his
      presence&mdash;without supposing any one would interfere. I dare not tell
      you what he said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever spite or revenge suggested to him, no doubt,&rdquo; said Jacqueline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Giselle&mdash;Oh, you must listen. I shall not be long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She forced her to sit down; she crouched on a foot stool at her feet,
      holding her hands in hers so tightly that Giselle could not draw them
      away, and began her story, with all its details, of what had happened to
      her since she left Fresne. She told of her meeting with Wanda; of the
      fatal evening which had resulted in her expulsion from the convent; her
      disgust at the Sparks family; the snare prepared for her by Madame
      Strahlberg. &ldquo;And I can not tell you all,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I can not tell you
      what drove me away from my true friends, and threw me among these people&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giselle&rsquo;s sad smile seemed to answer, &ldquo;No need&mdash;I am aware of it&mdash;I
      know my husband.&rdquo; Encouraged by this, Jacqueline went on with her
      confession, hiding nothing that was wrong, showing herself just as she had
      been, a poor, proud child who had set out to battle for herself in a
      dangerous world. At every step she had been more and more conscious of her
      own imprudence, of her own weakness, and of an ever-increasing desire to
      be done with independence; to submit to law, to be subject to any rules
      which would deliver her from the necessity of obeying no will but her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I am so disgusted with independence, with amusement, and
      amusing people! Tell me what to do in future&mdash;I am weary of taking
      charge of myself. I said so the other day to the Abbe Bardin. He is the
      only person I have seen since my return. It seems to me I am coming back
      to my old ideas&mdash;you remember how I once wished to end my days in the
      cell of a Carmelite? You might love me again then, perhaps, and Fred and
      poor Madame d&rsquo;Argy, who must feel so bitterly against me since her son was
      wounded, might forgive me. No one feels bitterly against the dead, and it
      is the same as being dead to be a Carmelite nun. You would all speak of me
      sometimes to each other as one who had been very unhappy, who had been
      guilty of great foolishness, but who had repaired her faults as best she
      could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Jacqueline! She was no longer a girl of the period; in her grief and
      humiliation she belonged to the past. Old-fashioned forms of penitence
      attracted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did the Abbe Bardin tell you?&rdquo; asked Giselle, with a slight
      movement of her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He only told me that he could not say at present whether that were my
      vocation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor can I,&rdquo; said Giselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline lifted up her face, wet with tears, which she had been leaning
      on the lap of Giselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not see what else I can do, unless you would get me a place as
      governess somewhere at the ends of the earth,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I could teach
      children their letters. I should not mind doing anything. I never should
      complain. Ah! if you lived all by yourself, Giselle, how I should implore
      you to take me to teach little Enguerrand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you might do better than that,&rdquo; said Giselle, wiping her friend&rsquo;s
      eyes almost as a mother might have done, &ldquo;if you would only listen to
      Fred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jacqueline&rsquo;s cheeks became crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mock me&mdash;it is cruel&mdash;I am too unworthy&mdash;it would
      pain me to see him. Shame&mdash;regret&mdash;you understand! But I can
      tell you one thing, Giselle&mdash;only you. You may tell it to him when he
      is quite old, when he has been long married, and when everything
      concerning me is a thing of the past. I never had loved any one with all
      my heart up to the moment when I read in that paper that he had fought for
      me, that his blood had flowed for me, that after all that had passed he
      still thought me worthy of being defended by him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her tears flowed fast, and she added: &ldquo;I shall be proud of that all the
      rest of my life! If only you, too, would forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heart of Giselle was melted by these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive you, my dear little girl? Ah! you have been better than I. I
      forgot our old friendship for a moment&mdash;I was harsh to you; and I
      have so little right to blame you! But come! Providence may have arranged
      all for the best, though one of us may have to suffer. Pray for that some
      one. Good-by&mdash;&lsquo;au revoir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kissed Jacqueline&rsquo;s forehead and was gone, before her cousin had
      seized the meaning of her last words. But joy and peace came back to
      Jacqueline. She had recovered her best friend, and had convinced her of
      her innocence.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. GENTLE CONSPIRATORS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Before Giselle went home to her own house she called on the Abbe Bardin,
      whom a rather surly servant was not disposed to disturb, as he was just
      eating his breakfast. The Abbe Bardin was Jacqueline&rsquo;s confessor, and he
      held the same relation to a number of other young girls who were among her
      particular friends. He was thoroughly acquainted with all that concerned
      their delicate and generally childish little souls. He kept them in the
      right way, had often a share in their marriages, and in general kept an
      eye upon them all their lives. Even when they escaped from him, as had
      happened in the case of Jacqueline, he did not give them up. He commended
      them to God, and looked forward to the time of their repentance with the
      patience of a father. The Abbe Bardin had never been willing to exercise
      any function but that of catechist; he had grown old in the humble rank of
      third assistant in a great parish, when, with a little ambition, he might
      have been its rector. &ldquo;Suffer little children to come unto me,&rdquo; had been
      his motto. These words of his Divine Master seemed more often than any
      others on his lips-lips so expressive of loving kindness, though sometimes
      a shrewd smile would pass over them and seem to say: &ldquo;I know, I can
      divine.&rdquo; But when this smile, the result of long experience, did not light
      up his features, the good Abbe Bardin looked like an elderly child; he was
      short, his walk was a trot, his face was round and ruddy, his eyes, which
      were short-sighted, were large, wide-open, and blue, and his heavy crop of
      white hair, which curled and crinkled above his forehead, made him look
      like a sixty-year-old angel, crowned with a silvery aureole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rubbing his hands affably, he came into the little parlor where Madame de
      Talbrun was waiting for him. There was probably no ecclesiastic in all
      Paris who had a salon so full of worked cushions, each of which was a
      keepsake&mdash;a souvenir of some first communion. The Abbe did not know
      his visitor, but the name Talbrun seemed to him connected with an
      honorable and well-meaning family. The lady was probably a mother who had
      come to put her child into his hands for religious instruction. He
      received visits from dozens of such mothers, some of whom were a little
      tiresome, from a wish to teach him what he knew better than they, and at
      one time he had set apart Wednesday as his day for receiving such visits,
      that he might not be too greatly disturbed, as seemed likely to happen to
      him that day. Not that he cared very much whether he ate his cutlet hot or
      cold, but his housekeeper cared a great deal. A man may be a very
      experienced director, and yet be subject to direction in other ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth of Giselle took him by surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur l&rsquo;Abbe,&rdquo; she said, without any preamble, while he begged her to
      sit down, &ldquo;I have come to speak to you of a person in whom you take an
      interest, Jacqueline de Nailles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He passed the back of his hand over his brow and said, with a sigh: &ldquo;Poor
      little thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is even more to be pitied than you think. You have not seen her, I
      believe, since last week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;she came. She has kept up, thank God, some of her religious
      duties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For all that, she has played a leading part in a recent scandal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Abbe sprang up from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A duel has taken place because of her, and her name is in all men&rsquo;s
      mouths&mdash;whispered, of course&mdash;but the quarrel took place at the
      Club. You know what it is to be talked of at the Club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poison of asps,&rdquo; growled the Abbe; &ldquo;oh! those clubs&mdash;think of
      all the evil reports concocted in them, of which women are the victims!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the present case the evil report was pure calumny. It was taken up by
      some one whom you also know&mdash;Frederic d&rsquo;Argy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had profound respect these many years for his excellent and pious
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so. In that case, Monsieur l&rsquo;Abbe, you would not object to
      going to Madame d&rsquo;Argy&rsquo;s house and asking how her son is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course not; but&mdash;it is my duty to disapprove&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will tell her that when a young man has compromised a young girl by
      defending her reputation in a manner too public, there is but one thing he
      can do afterward-marry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait one moment,&rdquo; said the Abbe, who was greatly surprised; &ldquo;it is
      certain that a good marriage would be the best thing for Jacqueline. I
      have been thinking of it. But I do not think I could so suddenly&mdash;so
      soon after&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Today at four o&rsquo;clock, Monsieur l&rsquo;Abbe. Time presses. You can add that
      such a marriage is the only way to stop a second duel, which will
      otherwise take place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is also the only way to bring Frederic to decide on sending in his
      resignation. Don&rsquo;t forget that&mdash;it is important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how do you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor Abbe stammered out his words, and counted on his fingers the
      arguments he was desired to make use of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will solemnly assure them that Jacqueline is innocent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! as to that, there are wolves in sheeps&rsquo; clothing, as the Bible tells
      us; but believe me, when such poor young things are in question, it is
      more often the sheep which has put on the appearance of a wolf&mdash;to
      seem in the fashion,&rdquo; added the Abbe, &ldquo;just to seem in the fashion.
      Fashion will authorize any kind of counterfeiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you will say all that, will you not, to Madame d&rsquo;Argy? It will be
      very good of you if you will. She will make no difficulties about money.
      All she wants is a quietly disposed daughter-in-law who will be willing to
      pass nine months of the year at Lizerolles, and Jacqueline is quite cured
      of her Paris fever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fever too often mortal,&rdquo; murmured the Abbe; &ldquo;oh, for the simplicity of
      nature! A priest whose lot is cast in the country is fortunate, Madame,
      but we can not choose our vocation. We may do good anywhere, especially in
      cities. Are you sure, however, that Jacqueline&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She loves Monsieur d&rsquo;Argy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if that is so, we are all right. The great misfortune with many of
      these poor girls is that they have never learned to love anything; they
      know nothing but agitations, excitements, curiosities, and fancies. All
      that sort of thing runs through their heads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are speaking of a Jacqueline before the duel. I can assure you that
      ever since yesterday, if not before, she has loved Monsieur d&rsquo;Argy, who on
      his part for a long time&mdash;a very long time&mdash;has been in love
      with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giselle spoke eagerly, as if she forced herself to say the words that cost
      her pain. Her cheeks were flushed under her veil. The Abbe, who was
      keen-sighted, observed these signs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued Giselle, &ldquo;if he is forced to forget her he may try to
      expend elsewhere the affection he feels for her; he may trouble the peace
      of others, while deceiving himself. He might make in the world one of
      those attachments&mdash;Do not fail to represent all these dangers to
      Madame d&rsquo;Argy when you plead the cause of Jacqueline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! You are evidently much attached, Madame, to Mademoiselle de
      Nailles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much, indeed,&rdquo; she answered, bravely, &ldquo;very much attached to her,
      and still more to him; therefore you understand that this marriage must&mdash;absolutely
      must take place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had risen and was folding her cloak round her, looking straight into
      the Abbe&rsquo;s eyes. Small as she was, their height was almost the same; she
      wanted him to understand thoroughly why this marriage must take place.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed. Up to that time he had not been quite sure that he had not to do
      with one of those wolves dressed in fleece whose appearance is as
      misleading as that of sheep disguised as wolves: now his opinion was
      settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu! Madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your reasons seem to me excellent&mdash;a
      duel to be prevented, a son to be kept by the side of his sick mother, two
      young people who love each other to be married, the saving, possibly, of
      two souls&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say three souls, Monsieur l&rsquo;Abbe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not ask whose was the third, nor even why she had insisted that
      this delicate commission must be executed that same day. He only bowed
      when she said again: &ldquo;At four o&rsquo;clock: Madame d&rsquo;Argy will be prepared to
      see you. Thank you, Monsieur l&rsquo;Abbe.&rdquo; And then, as she descended the
      staircase, he bestowed upon her silently his most earnest benediction,
      before returning to the cold cutlet that was on his breakfast table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giselle did not breakfast much better than he. In truth, M. de Talbrun
      being absent, she sat looking at her son, who was eating with a good
      appetite, while she drank only a cup of tea; after which, she dressed
      herself, with more than usual care, hiding by rice-powder the trace of
      recent tears on her complexion, and arranging her fair hair in the way
      that was most becoming to her, under a charming little bonnet covered with
      gold net-work which corresponded with the embroidery on an entirely new
      costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she went into the dining-room Enguerrand, who was there with his
      nurse finishing his dessert, cried out: &ldquo;Oh! mamma, how pretty you are!&rdquo;
       which went to her heart. She kissed him two or three times&mdash;one kiss
      after another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I try to be pretty for your sake, my darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take me with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I will come back for you, and take you out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She walked a few steps, and then turned to give him such a kiss as
      astonished him, for he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it really going to be long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you come back? You kiss me as if you were going for a long time,
      far away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I kissed you to give myself courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Enguerrand, who, when he had a hard lesson to learn, always did the same
      thing, appeared to understand her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to do some thing you don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I have to do it, because you see it is my duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do grown people have duties?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even more than children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t your duty to write a copy&mdash;your writing is so pretty.
      Oh! that&rsquo;s what I hate most. And you always say it is my duty to write my
      copy. I&rsquo;ll go and do it while you do your duty. So that will seem as if we
      were both together doing something we don&rsquo;t like&mdash;won&rsquo;t it, mamma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kissed him again, even more passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be always together, we two, my love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This word love struck the little ear of Enguerrand as having a new accent,
      a new meaning, and, boy-like, he tried to turn this excess of tenderness
      to advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you love me so much, will you take me to see the puppet-show?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anywhere you like&mdash;when I come back. Goodby.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XX. A CHIVALROUS SOUL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Madame D&rsquo;Argy sat knitting by the window in Fred&rsquo;s chamber, with that
      resigned but saddened air that mothers wear when they are occupied in
      repairing the consequences of some rash folly. Fred had seen her in his
      boyhood knitting in the same way with the same, look on her face, when he
      had been thrown from his pony, or had fallen from his velocipede. He
      himself looked ill at ease and worried, as he lay on a sofa with his arm
      in a sling. He was yawning and counting the hours. From time to time his
      mother glanced at him. Her look was curious, and anxious, and loving, all
      at the same time. He pretended to be asleep. He did not like to see her
      watching him. His handsome masculine face, tanned that pale brown which
      tropical climates give to fair complexions, looked odd as it rose above a
      light-blue cape, a very feminine garment which, as it had no sleeves, had
      been tied round his neck to keep him from being cold. He felt himself,
      with some impatience, at the mercy of the most tender, but the most
      sharp-eyed of nurses, a prisoner to her devotion, and made conscious of
      her power every moment. Her attentions worried him; he knew that they all
      meant &ldquo;It is your own fault, my poor boy, that you are in this state, and
      that your mother is so unhappy.&rdquo; He felt it. He knew as well as if she had
      spoken that she was asking him to return to reason, to marry, without more
      delay, their little neighbor in Normandy, Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Argeville, a
      niece of M. Martel, whom he persisted in not thinking of as a wife, always
      calling her a &ldquo;cider apple,&rdquo; in allusion to her red cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      A servant came in, and said to Madame d&rsquo;Argy that Madame de Talbrun was in
      the salon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am coming,&rdquo; she said, rolling up her knitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Fred suddenly woke up:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not ask her to come here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said his mother, with hesitation. She was distracted between
      her various anxieties; exasperated against the fatal influence of
      Jacqueline, alarmed by the increasing intimacy with Giselle, desirous that
      all such complications should be put an end to by his marriage, but
      terribly afraid that her &ldquo;cider apple&rdquo; would not be sufficient to
      accomplish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg Madame de Talbrun to come in here,&rdquo; she said, repeating the order
      after her son; but she settled herself in her chair with an air more
      patient, more resigned than ever, and her lips were firmly closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giselle entered in her charming new gown, and Fred&rsquo;s first words, like
      those of Enguerrand, were: &ldquo;How pretty you are! It is charity,&rdquo; he added,
      smiling, &ldquo;to present such a spectacle to the eyes of a sick man; it is
      enough to set him up again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Giselle, kissing Madame d&rsquo;Argy on the forehead. The poor
      mother had resumed her knitting with a sigh, hardly glancing at the pretty
      walking-costume, nor at the bonnet with its network of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it pretty?&rdquo; repeated Giselle. &ldquo;I am delighted with this costume. It
      is made after one of Rejane&rsquo;s. Oscar fell in love with it at a first
      representation of a vaudeville, and he gave me over into the hands of the
      same dressmaker, who indeed was named in the play. That kind of
      advertising seems very effective.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went on chattering thus to put off what she had really come to say.
      Her heart was beating so fast that its throbs could be seen under the
      embroidered front of the bodice which fitted her so smoothly. She wondered
      how Madame d&rsquo;Argy would receive the suggestion she was about to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went on: &ldquo;I dressed myself in my best to-day because I am so happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame d&rsquo;Argy&rsquo;s long tortoise-shell knitting-needles stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear it, my dear,&rdquo; she said, coldly, &ldquo;I am glad anybody can
      be happy. There are so many of us who are sad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why are you pleased?&rdquo; asked Fred, looking at her, as if by some
      instinct he understood that he had something to do with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our prodigal has returned,&rdquo; answered Giselle, with a little air of
      satisfaction, very artificial, however, for she could hardly breathe, so
      great was her fear and her emotion. &ldquo;My house is in the garb of
      rejoicing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prodigal? Do you mean your husband?&rdquo; said Madame d&rsquo;Argy, maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I despair of him,&rdquo; replied Giselle, lightly. &ldquo;No, I speak of a
      prodigal who did not go far, and who made haste to repent. I am speaking
      of Jacqueline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was complete silence. The knitting-needles ticked rapidly, a slight
      flush rose on the dark cheeks of Fred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I beg,&rdquo; said Madame d&rsquo;Argy, &ldquo;is that you will not ask me to eat the
      fatted calf in her honor. The comings and going of Mademoiselle de Nailles
      have long ceased to have the slightest interest for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have for Fred at any rate; he has just proved it, I should say,&rdquo;
       replied Giselle.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the others were as much embarrassed as Giselle. She saw it,
      and went on quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their names are together in everybody&rsquo;s mouth; you can not hinder it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret it deeply-and allow me to make one remark: it seems to me you
      show a want of tact such as I should never have imagined in telling us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giselle read in Fred&rsquo;s eyes, which were steadily fixed on her, that he
      was, on that point, of his mother&rsquo;s opinion. She went on, however, still
      pretending to blunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me&mdash;but I have been so anxious about you ever since I heard
      there was to be a second meeting&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A second meeting!&rdquo; screamed Madame d&rsquo;Argy, who, as she read no paper but
      the Gazette de France, or occasionally the Debats, knew nothing of all the
      rumors that find their echo in the daily papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, &lsquo;mon Dieu&rsquo;! I thought you knew&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not frighten my mother,&rdquo; said Fred, almost angrily; &ldquo;Monsieur de
      Cymier has written a letter which puts an end to our quarrel. It is the
      letter of a man of honor apologizing for having spoken lightly, for having
      repeated false rumors without verifying them&mdash;in short, retracting
      all that he had said that reflected in any way on Mademoiselle de Nailles,
      and authorizing me, if I think best, to make public his retraction. After
      that we can have nothing more to say to each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He who makes himself the champion to defend a young girl&rsquo;s character,&rdquo;
       said Madame d&rsquo;Argy, sententiously, &ldquo;injures her as much as those who have
      spoken evil of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is exactly what I think,&rdquo; said Giselle. &ldquo;The self-constituted
      champion has given the evil rumor circulation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was again a painful silence. Then the intrepid little woman resumed:
      &ldquo;This step on the part of Monsieur de Cymier seems to have rendered my
      errand unnecessary. I had thought of a way to end this sad affair; a very
      simple way, much better, most certainly, than men cutting their own
      throats or those of other people. But since peace has been made over the
      ruins of Jacqueline&rsquo;s reputation, I had better say nothing and go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no! Let us hear what you had to propose,&rdquo; said Fred, getting up
      from his couch so quickly that he jarred his bandaged arm, and uttered a
      cry of pain, which seemed very much like an oath, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giselle was silent. Standing before the hearth, she was warming her small
      feet, watching, as she did so, Madame d&rsquo;Argy&rsquo;s profile, which was
      reflected in the mirror. It was severe&mdash;impenetrable. It was Fred who
      spoke first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; he said, hesitating, &ldquo;are you sure that Mademoiselle
      de Nailles has not just arrived from Monaco?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am certain that for a week she has been living quietly with Modeste,
      and that, though she passed through Monaco, she did not stay there&mdash;twenty-four
      hours, finding that the air of that place did not agree with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what do you say to what Monsieur Martel saw with his own eyes, and
      which is confirmed by public rumor?&rdquo; cried Madame d&rsquo;Argy, as if she were
      giving a challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Martel saw Jacqueline in bad company. She was not there of her
      own will. As to public rumor, we may feel sure that to make it as
      flattering to her tomorrow as it is otherwise to-day only a marriage is
      necessary. Yes, a marriage! That is the way I had thought of to settle
      everything and make everybody happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What man would marry a girl who had compromised herself?&rdquo; said Madame
      d&rsquo;Argy, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He who has done his part to compromise her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go and propose it to Monsieur de Cymier!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It is not Monsieur de Cymier whom she loves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Madame d&rsquo;Argy was on her feet at once. &ldquo;Indeed, Giselle, you are
      losing your senses. If I were not afraid of agitating Fred&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was, in truth, greatly agitated. The only hand that he could use was
      pulling and tearing at the little blue cape crossed on his breast, in
      which his mother had wrapped him; and this unsuitable garment formed such
      a queer contrast to the expression of his face that Giselle, in her
      nervous excitement, burst out laughing, an explosion of merriment which
      completed the exasperation of Madame d&rsquo;Argy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she cried, beside herself. &ldquo;You hear me&mdash;never will I
      consent, whatever happens!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the door was partly opened, and a servant announced
      &ldquo;Monsieur l&rsquo;Abbe Bardin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame d&rsquo;Argy made a gesture which was anything but reverential.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to be sure&mdash;this is the right moment with a vengeance! What
      does he want! Does he wish me to assist in some good work&mdash;or to
      undertake to collect money, which I hate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Above all, mother,&rdquo; cried Fred, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t expose me to the fatigue of
      receiving his visit. Go and see him yourself. Giselle will take care of
      your patient while you are gone. Won&rsquo;t you, Giselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice was soft, and very affectionate. He evidently was not angry at
      what she had dared to say, and she acknowledged this to herself with an
      aching heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly trust your kind of care,&rdquo; said Madame d&rsquo;Argy, with a
      smile that was not gay, and certainly not amiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went, however, because Fred repeated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But go and see the Abbe Bardin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had she left the room when Fred got up from his sofa and approached
      Giselle with passionate eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure I am not dreaming,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Is it you&mdash;really you who
      advise me to marry Jacqueline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who else should it be?&rdquo; she answered, very calm to all appearance. &ldquo;Who
      can know better than I? But first you must oblige me by lying down again,
      or else I will not say one word more. That is right. Now keep still. Your
      mother is furiously displeased with me&mdash;I am sorry&mdash;but she will
      get over it. I know that in Jacqueline you would have a good wife&mdash;a
      wife far better than the Jacqueline you would have married formerly. She
      has paid dearly for her experience of life, and has profited by its
      lessons, so that she is now worthy of you, and sincerely repentant for her
      childish peccadilloes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Giselle,&rdquo; said Fred, &ldquo;look me full in the face&mdash;yes, look into my
      eyes frankly and hide nothing. Your eyes never told anything but the
      truth. Why do you turn them away? Do you really and truly wish this
      marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him steadily as long as he would, and let him hold her hand,
      which was burning inside her glove, and which with a great effort she
      prevented from trembling. Then her nerves gave way under his long and
      silent gaze, which seemed to question her, and she laughed, a laugh that
      sounded to herself very unnatural.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor, dear friend,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;how easily you men are duped! You are
      trying to find out, to discover whether, in case you decide upon an honest
      act, a perfectly sensible act, to which you are strongly inclined&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      tell me you are not&mdash;whether, in short, you marry Jacqueline, I shall
      be really as glad of it as I pretend. But have you not found out what I
      have aimed at all along? Do you think I did not know from the very first
      what it was that made you seek me?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not the rope, but I had lived near the rose; I reminded you of her
      continually. We two loved her; each of us felt we did. Even when you said
      harm of her, I knew it was merely because you longed to utter her name,
      and repeat to yourself her perfections. I laughed, yes, I laughed to
      myself, and I was careful how I contradicted you. I tried to keep you safe
      for her, to prevent your going elsewhere and forming attachments which
      might have resulted in your forgetting her. I did my best&mdash;do me
      justice&mdash;I did my best; perhaps sometimes I pushed things a little
      far in her interest, in that of your mother, but in yours more than all;
      in yours, for God knows I am all for you,&rdquo; said Giselle, with sudden and
      involuntary fervor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am all yours as a friend, a faithful friend,&rdquo; she resumed, almost
      frightened by the tones of her own voice; &ldquo;but as to the slightest feeling
      of love between us, love the most spiritual, the most platonic&mdash;yes,
      all men, I fancy, have a little of that kind of self-conceit. Dear Fred,
      don&rsquo;t imagine it&mdash;Enguerrand would never have allowed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was smiling, half laughing, and he looked at her with astonishment,
      asking himself whether he could believe what she was saying, when he could
      recollect what seemed to him so many proofs to the contrary. Yet in what
      she said there was no hesitation, no incoherence, no false note. Pride,
      noble pride, upheld her to the end. The first falsehood of her life was a
      masterpiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Giselle!&rdquo; he said at last, not knowing what to think, &ldquo;I adore you! I
      revere you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, with a smile, gracious, yet with a touch of sadness,
      &ldquo;I know you do. But her you love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Might it not have been sweet to her had he answered &ldquo;No, I loved her once,
      and remembered that old love enough to risk my life for her, but in
      reality I now love only you&mdash;all the more at this moment when I see
      you love me more than yourself.&rdquo; But, instead, he murmured only, like a
      man and a lover: &ldquo;And Jacqueline&mdash;do you think she loves me?&rdquo; His
      anxiety, a thrill that ran through all his frame, the light in his eyes,
      his sudden pallor, told more than his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Giselle could have doubted his love for Jacqueline before, she would
      have now been convinced of it. The conviction stabbed her to the heart.
      Death is not that last sleep in which all our faculties, weakened and
      exhausted, fail us; it is the blow which annihilates our supreme illusion
      and leaves us disabused in a cold and empty world. People walk, talk, and
      smile after this death&mdash;another ghost is added to the drama played on
      the stage of the world; but the real self is dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giselle was too much of a woman, angelic as she was, to have any courage
      left to say: &ldquo;Yes, I know she loves you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said instead, in a low voice: &ldquo;That is a question you must ask of
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, in the next room they could hear Madame d&rsquo;Argy vehemently
      repeating: &ldquo;Never! No, I never will consent! Is it a plot between you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They heard also a rumbling monotone preceding each of these vehement
      interruptions. The Abbe Bardin was pointing out to her that, unmarried,
      her son would return to Tonquin, that Lizerolles would be left deserted,
      her house would be desolate without daughter-in-law or grandchildren; and,
      as he drew these pictures, he came back, again and again, to his main
      argument:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will answer for their happiness: I will answer for the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His authority as a priest gave weight to this assurance, at least Madame
      d&rsquo;Argy felt it so. She went on saying never, but less and less
      emphatically, and apparently she ceased to say it at last, for three
      months later the d&rsquo;Etaples, the Rays, the d&rsquo;Avrignys and the rest,
      received two wedding announcements in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame d&rsquo;Argy has the honor to inform you of the marriage of her son, M.
      Frederic d&rsquo;Argy, Chevalier of the Legion of Honor, to Mademoiselle de
      Nailles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The accompanying card ran thus:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;The Baroness de Nailles has the honor to inform you of the
     marriage of Mademoiselle Jacqueline de Nailles, her
     stepdaughter, to M. Frederic d&rsquo;Argy.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Congratulations showered down on both mother and stepmother. A love-match
      is nowadays so rare! It turned out that every one had always wished all
      kinds of good fortune to young Madame d&rsquo;Argy, and every one seemed to take
      a sincere part in the joy that was expressed on the occasion, even Dolly,
      who, it was said, had in secret set her heart on Fred for herself; even
      Nora Sparks, who, not having carried out her plans, had gone back to New
      York, whence she sent a superb wedding present. Madame de Nailles
      apparently experienced at the wedding all the emotions of a real mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roses at Lizerolles bloomed that year with unusual beauty, as if to
      welcome the young pair. Modeste sang &lsquo;Nunc Dimittis&rsquo;. The least
      demonstrative of all those interested in the event was Giselle.

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
