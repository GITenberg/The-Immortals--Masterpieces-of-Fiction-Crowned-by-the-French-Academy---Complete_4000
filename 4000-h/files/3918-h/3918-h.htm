      GENERAL INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1905
    </h3>
    <p>
      BY ROBERT ARNOT
    </p>
    <p>
      The editor-in-chief of the Maison Mazarin&mdash;a man of letters who
      cherishes an enthusiastic yet discriminating love for the literary and
      artistic glories of France&mdash;formed within the last two years the
      great project of collecting and presenting to the vast numbers of
      intelligent readers of whom New World boasts a series of those great and
      undying romances which, since 1784, have received the crown of merit
      awarded by the French Academy&mdash;that coveted assurance of immortality
      in letters and in art.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the presentation of this serious enterprise for the criticism and
      official sanction of The Academy, &lsquo;en seance&rsquo;, was included a request
      that, if possible, the task of writing a preface to the series should be
      undertaken by me. Official sanction having been bestowed upon the plan, I,
      as the accredited officer of the French Academy, convey to you its hearty
      appreciation, endorsement, and sympathy with a project so nobly artistic.
      It is also my duty, privilege, and pleasure to point out, at the request
      of my brethren, the peculiar importance and lasting value of this series
      to all who would know the inner life of a people whose greatness no turns
      of fortune have been able to diminish.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the last hundred years France has experienced the most terrible
      vicissitudes, but, vanquished or victorious, triumphant or abased, never
      has she lost her peculiar gift of attracting the curiosity of the world.
      She interests every living being, and even those who do not love her
      desire to know her. To this peculiar attraction which radiates from her,
      artists and men of letters can well bear witness, since it is to
      literature and to the arts, before all, that France owes such living and
      lasting power. In every quarter of the civilized world there are
      distinguished writers, painters, and eminent musicians, but in France they
      exist in greater numbers than elsewhere. Moreover, it is universally
      conceded that French writers and artists have this particular and
      praiseworthy quality: they are most accessible to people of other
      countries. Without losing their national characteristics, they possess the
      happy gift of universality. To speak of letters alone: the books that
      Frenchmen write are read, translated, dramatized, and imitated everywhere;
      so it is not strange that these books give to foreigners a desire for a
      nearer and more intimate acquaintance with France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men preserve an almost innate habit of resorting to Paris from almost
      every quarter of the globe. For many years American visitors have been
      more numerous than others, although the journey from the United States is
      long and costly. But I am sure that when for the first time they see Paris&mdash;its
      palaces, its churches, its museums&mdash;and visit Versailles,
      Fontainebleau, and Chantilly, they do not regret the travail they have
      undergone. Meanwhile, however, I ask myself whether such sightseeing is
      all that, in coming hither, they wish to accomplish. Intelligent
      travellers&mdash;and, as a rule, it is the intelligent class that feels
      the need of the educative influence of travel&mdash;look at our beautiful
      monuments, wander through the streets and squares among the crowds that
      fill them, and, observing them, I ask myself again: Do not such people
      desire to study at closer range these persons who elbow them as they pass;
      do they not wish to enter the houses of which they see but the facades; do
      they not wish to know how Parisians live and speak and act by their
      firesides? But time, alas! is lacking for the formation of those intimate
      friendships which would bring this knowledge within their grasp. French
      homes are rarely open to birds of passage, and visitors leave us with
      regret that they have not been able to see more than the surface of our
      civilization or to recognize by experience the note of our inner home
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      How, then, shall this void be filled? Speaking in the first person, the
      simplest means appears to be to study those whose profession it is to
      describe the society of the time, and primarily, therefore, the works of
      dramatic writers, who are supposed to draw a faithful picture of it. So we
      go to the theatre, and usually derive keen pleasure therefrom. But is
      pleasure all that we expect to find? What we should look for above
      everything in a comedy or a drama is a representation, exact as possible,
      of the manners and characters of the dramatis persona of the play; and
      perhaps the conditions under which the play was written do not allow such
      representation. The exact and studied portrayal of a character demands
      from the author long preparation, and cannot be accomplished in a few
      hours. From, the first scene to the last, each tale must be posed in the
      author&rsquo;s mind exactly as it will be proved to be at the end. It is the
      author&rsquo;s aim and mission to place completely before his audience the souls
      of the &ldquo;agonists&rdquo; laying bare the complications of motive, and throwing
      into relief the delicate shades of motive that sway them. Often, too, the
      play is produced before a numerous audience&mdash;an audience often
      distrait, always pressed for time, and impatient of the least delay.
      Again, the public in general require that they shall be able to understand
      without difficulty, and at first thought, the characters the author seeks
      to present, making it necessary that these characters be depicted from
      their most salient sides&mdash;which are too often vulgar and
      unattractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our comedies and dramas it is not the individual that is drawn, but the
      type. Where the individual alone is real, the type is a myth of the
      imagination&mdash;a pure invention. And invention is the mainspring of the
      theatre, which rests purely upon illusion, and does not please us unless
      it begins by deceiving us.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe, then, that if one seeks to know the world exactly as it is, the
      theatre does not furnish the means whereby one can pursue the study. A far
      better opportunity for knowing the private life of a people is available
      through the medium of its great novels. The novelist deals with each
      person as an individual. He speaks to his reader at an hour when the mind
      is disengaged from worldly affairs, and he can add without restraint every
      detail that seems needful to him to complete the rounding of his story. He
      can return at will, should he choose, to the source of the plot he is
      unfolding, in order that his reader may better understand him; he can
      emphasize and dwell upon those details which an audience in a theatre will
      not allow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader, being at leisure, feels no impatience, for he knows that he
      can at any time lay down or take up the book. It is the consciousness of
      this privilege that gives him patience, should he encounter a dull page
      here or there. He may hasten or delay his reading, according to the
      interest he takes in his romance-nay, more, he can return to the earlier
      pages, should he need to do so, for a better comprehension of some obscure
      point. In proportion as he is attracted and interested by the romance, and
      also in the degree of concentration with which he reads it, does he grasp
      better the subtleties of the narrative. No shade of character drawing
      escapes him. He realizes, with keener appreciation, the most delicate of
      human moods, and the novelist is not compelled to introduce the characters
      to him, one by one, distinguishing them only by the most general
      characteristics, but can describe each of those little individual
      idiosyncrasies that contribute to the sum total of a living personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I add that the dramatic author is always to a certain extent a slave
      to the public, and must ever seek to please the passing taste of his time,
      it will be recognized that he is often, alas! compelled to sacrifice his
      artistic leanings to popular caprice-that is, if he has the natural desire
      that his generation should applaud him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a rule, with the theatre-going masses, one person follows the fads or
      fancies of others, and individual judgments are too apt to be irresistibly
      swayed by current opinion. But the novelist, entirely independent of his
      reader, is not compelled to conform himself to the opinion of any person,
      or to submit to his caprices. He is absolutely free to picture society as
      he sees it, and we therefore can have more confidence in his descriptions
      of the customs and characters of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is precisely this view of the case that the editor of the series has
      taken, and herein is the raison d&rsquo;etre of this collection of great French
      romances. The choice was not easy to make. That form of literature called
      the romance abounds with us. France has always loved it, for French
      writers exhibit a curiosity&mdash;and I may say an indiscretion&mdash;that
      is almost charming in the study of customs and morals at large; a quality
      that induces them to talk freely of themselves and of their neighbors, and
      to set forth fearlessly both the good and the bad in human nature. In this
      fascinating phase of literature, France never has produced greater
      examples than of late years.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the collection here presented to American readers will be found those
      works especially which reveal the intimate side of French social
      life-works in which are discussed the moral problems that affect most
      potently the life of the world at large. If inquiring spirits seek to
      learn the customs and manners of the France of any age, they must look for
      it among her crowned romances. They need go back no farther than Ludovic
      Halevy, who may be said to open the modern epoch. In the romantic school,
      on its historic side, Alfred de Vigny must be looked upon as supreme. De
      Musset and Anatole France may be taken as revealing authoritatively the
      moral philosophy of nineteenth-century thought. I must not omit to mention
      the Jacqueline of Th. Bentzon, and the &ldquo;Attic&rdquo; Philosopher of Emile
      Souvestre, nor the great names of Loti, Claretie, Coppe, Bazin, Bourget,
      Malot, Droz, De Massa, and last, but not least, our French Dickens,
      Alphonse Daudet. I need not add more; the very names of these &ldquo;Immortals&rdquo;
       suffice to commend the series to readers in all countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      One word in conclusion: America may rest assured that her students of
      international literature will find in this series of &lsquo;ouvrages couronnes&rsquo; 
      all that they may wish to know of France at her own fireside&mdash;a
      knowledge that too often escapes them, knowledge that embraces not only a
      faithful picture of contemporary life in the French provinces, but a
      living and exact description of French society in modern times. They may
      feel certain that when they have read these romances, they will have
      sounded the depths and penetrated into the hidden intimacies of France,
      not only as she is, but as she would be known.

    <h2>
      GEORGES OHNET
    </h2>
    <p>
      The only French novelist whose books have a circulation approaching the
      works of Daudet and of Zola is Georges Ohnet, a writer whose popularity is
      as interesting as his stories, because it explains, though it does not
      excuse, the contempt the Goncourts had for the favor of the great French
      public, and also because it shows how the highest form of Romanticism
      still ferments beneath the varnish of Naturalism in what is called genius
      among the great masses of readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georges Ohnet was born in Paris, April 3, 1848, the son of an architect.
      He was destined for the Bar, but was early attracted by journalism and
      literature. Being a lawyer it was not difficult for him to join the
      editorial staff of Le Pays, and later Le Constitutionnel. This was soon
      after the Franco-German War. His romances, since collected under the title
      &lsquo;Batailles de la Vie&rsquo;, appeared first in &lsquo;Le Figaro, L&rsquo;Illustration, and
      Revue des Deux Mondes&rsquo;, and have been exceedingly well received by the
      public. This relates also to his dramas, some of his works meeting with a
      popular success rarely extended to any author. For some time Georges Ohnet
      did not find the same favor with the critics, who often attacked him with
      a passionate violence and unusual severity. True, a high philosophical
      flow of thoughts cannot be detected in his writings, but nevertheless it
      is certain that the characters and the subjects of which he treats are
      brilliantly sketched and clearly developed. They are likewise of perfect
      morality and honesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was expected of him, however, an idea which was not quite realized.
      Appearing upon the literary stage at a period when Naturalism was
      triumphant, it was for a moment believed that he would restore Idealism in
      the manner of George Sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case the hostile critics have lost. For years public opinion has
      exalted him, and the reaction is the more significant when compared with
      the tremendous criticism launched against his early romances and novels.
    </p>
    <p>
      A list of his works follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge Panine (1881), crowned by the French Academy, has since gone through
      one hundred and fifty French editions; Le Maitre des Forges (1882), a
      prodigious success, two hundred and fifty editions being printed (1900);
      La Comtesse Sarah (1882); Lise Fleuyon (1884); La Grande Maynieye (1886);
      Les Dames de Croix-Mort (1886); Volonte (1888); Le Docteur Rameau (1889);
      Deynier Amour (1889); Le Cure de Favieyes (1890); Dette de Haine (1891);
      Nemsod et Cie. (1892); Le Lendemain des Amours (1893); Le Droit de
      l&rsquo;Enfant (1894.); Les Vielles Rancunes (1894); La Dame en Gris (1895); La
      Fille du Depute (1896); Le Roi de Paris (1898); Au Fond du Gouffre (1899);
      Gens de la Noce (1900); La Tenibreuse (1900); Le Cyasseur d&rsquo;Affaires
      (1901); Le Crepuscule (1901); Le Marche a l&rsquo;Amour (1902).
    </p>
    <p>
      Ohnet&rsquo;s novels are collected under the titles, &lsquo;Noir et Rose (1887) and
      L&rsquo;Ame de Pierre (1890).
    </p>
    <p>
      The dramatic writings of Georges Ohnet, mostly taken from his novels, have
      greatly contributed to his reputation. Le Maitre des Forges was played for
      a full year (Gymnase, 1883); it was followed by Serge Panine (1884); La
      Comtesse Sarah (1887). La Grande Mayniere (1888), met also with a decided
      and prolonged success; Dernier Amour (Gymnase, 1890); Colonel Roquebrune
      (Porte St. Martin, 1897). Before that he had already written the plays
      Regina Sarpi (1875) and Marthe (1877), which yet hold a prominent place
      upon the French stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have shown in this rapid sketch that a man of the stamp of Georges Ohnet
      must have immortal qualities in himself, even though flayed and roasted
      alive by the critics. He is most assuredly an artist in form, is endowed
      with a brilliant style, and has been named &ldquo;L&rsquo;Historiographe de la
      bourgeoise contemporaine.&rdquo; Indeed, antagonism to plutocracy and hatred of
      aristocracy are the fundamental theses in almost every one of his books.
    </p>
    <p>
      His exposition, I repeat, is startlingly neat, the development of his
      plots absolutely logical, and the world has acclaimed his ingenuity in
      dramatic construction. He is truly, and in all senses, of the Ages.

      CHAPTER I. THE HOUSE OF DESVARENNES
    </h2>
    <p>
      The firm of Desvarennes has been in an ancient mansion in the Rue Saint
      Dominique since 1875; it is one of the best known and most important in
      French industry. The counting-houses are in the wings of the building
      looking upon the courtyard, which were occupied by the servants when the
      family whose coat-of-arms has been effaced from above the gate-way were
      still owners of the estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes inhabits the mansion which she has had magnificently
      renovated. A formidable rival of the Darblays, the great millers of
      France, the firm of Desvarennes is a commercial and political power.
      Inquire in Paris about its solvency, and you will be told that you may
      safely advance twenty millions of francs on the signature of the head of
      the firm. And this head is a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      This woman is remarkable. Gifted with keen understanding and a firm will,
      she had in former times vowed to make a large fortune, and she has kept
      her word.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the daughter of a humble packer of the Rue Neuve-Coquenard. Toward
      1848 she married Michel Desvarennes, who was then a journeyman baker in a
      large shop in the Chaussee d&rsquo;Antin. With the thousand francs which the
      packer managed to give his daughter by way of dowry, the young couple
      boldly took a shop and started a little bakery business. The husband
      kneaded and baked the bread, and the young wife, seated at the counter,
      kept watch over the till. Neither on Sundays nor on holidays was the shop
      shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the window, between two pyramids of pink and blue packets of
      biscuits, one could always catch sight of the serious-looking Madame
      Desvarennes, knitting woollen stockings for her husband while waiting for
      customers. With her prominent forehead, and her eyes always bent on her
      work, this woman appeared the living image of perseverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of five years of incessant work, and possessing twenty thousand
      francs, saved sou by sou, the Desvarennes left the slopes of Montmartre,
      and moved to the centre of Paris. They were ambitious and full of
      confidence. They set up in the Rue Vivienne, in a shop resplendent with
      gilding and ornamented with looking-glasses. The ceiling was painted in
      panels with bright hued pictures that caught the eyes of the passers-by.
      The window-shelves were of white marble, and the counter, where Madame
      Desvarennes was still enthroned, was of a width worthy of the receipts
      that were taken every day. Business increased daily; the Desvarennes
      continued to be hard and systematic workers. The class of customers alone
      had changed; they were more numerous and richer. The house had a specialty
      for making small rolls for the restaurants. Michel had learned from the
      Viennese bakers how to make those golden balls which tempt the most
      rebellious appetite, and which, when in an artistically folded damask
      napkin, set off a dinner-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time Madame Desvarennes, while calculating how much the millers
      must gain on the flour they sell to the bakers, resolved, in order to
      lessen expenses, to do without middlemen and grind her own corn. Michel,
      naturally timid, was frightened when his wife disclosed to him the simple
      project which she had formed. Accustomed to submit to the will of her whom
      he respectfully called &ldquo;the mistress,&rdquo; and of whom he was but the head
      clerk, he dared not oppose her. But, a red-tapist by nature, and hating
      innovations, owing to weakness of mind, he trembled inwardly and cried in
      agony:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wife, you&rsquo;ll ruin us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mistress calmed the poor man&rsquo;s alarm; she tried to impart to him some
      of her confidence, to animate him with her hope, but without success, so
      she went on without him. A mill was for sale at Jouy, on the banks of the
      Oise; she paid ready money for it, and a few weeks later the bakery in the
      Rue Vivienne was independent of every one. She ground her own flour, and
      from that time business increased considerably. Feeling capable of
      carrying out large undertakings, and, moreover, desirous of giving up the
      meannesses of retail trade, Madame Desvarennes, one fine day, sent in a
      tender for supplying bread to the military hospitals. It was accepted, and
      from that time the house ranked among the most important. On seeing the
      Desvarennes take their daring flight, the leading men in the trade had
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have system and activity, and if they do not upset on the way, they
      will attain a high position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the mistress seemed to have the gift of divination. She worked surely&mdash;if
      she struck out one way you might be certain that success was there. In all
      her enterprises, &ldquo;good luck&rdquo; stood close by her; she scented failures from
      afar, and the firm never made a bad debt. Still Michel continued to
      tremble. The first mill had been followed by many more; then the old
      system appeared insufficient to Madame Desvarennes. As she wished to keep
      up with the increase of business she had steam-mills built,&mdash;which
      are now grinding three hundred million francs&rsquo; worth of corn every year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortune had favored the house immensely, but Michel continued to tremble.
      From time to time when the mistress launched out a new business, he
      timidly ventured on his usual saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wife, you&rsquo;re going to ruin us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But one felt it was only for form&rsquo;s sake, and that he himself no longer
      meant what he said. Madame Desvarennes received this plaintive
      remonstrance with a calm smile, and answered, maternally, as to a child:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, don&rsquo;t be frightened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she would set to work again, and direct with irresistible vigor the
      army of clerks who peopled her counting-houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fifteen years&rsquo; time, by prodigious efforts of will and energy, Madame
      Desvarennes had made her way from the lonely and muddy Rue Neuve-Coquenard
      to the mansion in the Rue Saint-Dominique. Of the bakery there was no
      longer question. It was some time since the business in the Rue Vivienne
      had been transferred to the foreman of the shop. The flour trade alone
      occupied Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s attention. She ruled the prices in the
      market; and great bankers came to her office and did business with her on
      a footing of equality. She did not become any prouder for it, she knew too
      well the strength and weakness of life to have pride; her former plain
      dealing had not stiffened into self-sufficiency. Such as one had known her
      when beginning business, such one found her in the zenith of her fortune.
      Instead of a woollen gown she wore a silk one, but the color was still
      black; her language had not become refined; she retained the same blunt
      familiar accent, and at the end of five minutes&rsquo; conversation with any one
      of importance she could not resist calling him &ldquo;my dear,&rdquo; to come morally
      near him. Her commands had more fulness. In giving her orders, she had the
      manner of a commander-in-chief, and it was useless to haggle when she had
      spoken. The best thing to do was to obey, as well and as promptly as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Placed in a political sphere, this marvellously gifted woman would have
      been a Madame Roland; born to the throne, she would have been a Catherine
      II.; there was genius in her. Sprung from the lower ranks, her superiority
      had given her wealth; had she come from the higher, the great mind might
      have governed the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still she was not happy; she had been married fifteen years, and her
      fireside was devoid of a cradle. During the first years she had rejoiced
      at not having a child. Where could she have found time to occupy herself
      with a baby? Business engrossed her attention; she had no leisure to amuse
      herself with trifles. Maternity seemed to her a luxury for rich women; she
      had her fortune to make. In the struggle against the difficulties
      attending the enterprise she had begun, she had not had time to look
      around her and perceive that her home was lonely. She worked from morning
      till night. Her whole life was absorbed in this work, and when night came,
      overcome with fatigue, she fell asleep, her head filled with cares which
      stifled all tricks of the imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michel grieved, but in silence; his feeble and dependent nature missed a
      child. He, whose mind lacked occupation, thought of the future. He said to
      himself that the day when the dreamt-of fortune came would be more welcome
      if there were an heir to whom to leave it. What was the good of being
      rich, if the money went to collateral relatives? There was his nephew
      Savinien, a disagreeable urchin whom he looked on with indifference; and
      he was biased regarding his brother, who had all but failed several times
      in business, and to whose aid he had come to save the honor of the name.
      The mistress had not hesitated to help him, and had prevented the
      signature of &ldquo;Desvarennes&rdquo; being protested. She had not taunted him,
      having as large a heart as she had a mind. But Michel had felt humiliated
      to see his own folk make a gap in the financial edifice erected so
      laboriously by his wife. Out of this had gradually sprung a sense of
      dissatisfaction with the Desvarennes of the other branch, which manifested
      itself by a marked coolness, when, by chance, his brother came to the
      house, accompanied by his son Savinien.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the paternity of his brother made him secretly jealous. Why
      should that incapable fellow, who succeeded in nothing, have a son? It was
      only those ne&rsquo;er-do-well sort of people who were thus favored. He, Michel,
      already called the rich Desvarennes, he had not a son. Was it just? But
      where is there justice in this world?
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time that she saw him with a downcast face the mistress had
      questioned him, and he had frankly expressed his regrets. But he had been
      so repelled by his wife, in whose heart a great trouble, steadily
      repressed, however, had been produced, that he never dared to recur to the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      He suffered in silence. But he no longer suffered alone. Like an
      overflowing river that finds an outlet in the valley, which it inundates,
      the longings for maternity, hitherto repressed by the preoccupations of
      business, had suddenly seized Madame Desvarennes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong and unyielding, she struggled and would not own herself conquered.
      Still she became sad. Her voice sounded less sonorously in the offices
      where she gave an order; her energetic nature seemed subdued. Now she
      looked around her. She beheld prosperity made stable by incessant work,
      respect gained by spotless honesty; she had attained the goal which she
      had marked out in her ambitious dreams, as being paradise itself. Paradise
      was there; but it lacked the angel. They had no child.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that day a change came over this woman, slowly but surely; scarcely
      perceptible to strangers, but easy to be seen by those around her. She
      became benevolent, and gave away considerable sums of money, especially to
      children&rsquo;s &ldquo;Homes.&rdquo; But when the good people who governed these
      establishments, lured on by her generosity, came to ask her to be on their
      committee of management, she became angry, asking them if they were joking
      with her? What interest could those brats have for her? She had other fish
      to fry. She gave them what they needed, and what more could they want? The
      fact was she felt weak and troubled before children. But within her a
      powerful and unknown voice had arisen, and the hour was not far distant
      when the bitter wave of her regrets was to overflow and be made manifest.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not like Savinien, her nephew, and kept all her sweetness for the
      son of one of their old neighbors in the Rue Neuve-Coquenard, a small
      haberdasher, who had not been able to get on, but continued humbly to sell
      thread and needles to the thrifty folks of the neighborhood. The
      haberdasher, Mother Delarue, as she was called, had remained a widow after
      one year of married life. Pierre, her boy, had grown up under the shadow
      of the bakery, the cradle of the Desvarennes&rsquo;s fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sundays the mistress would give him a gingerbread or a cracknel, and
      amuse herself with his baby prattle. She did not lose sight of him when
      she removed to the Rue Vivienne. Pierre had entered the elementary school
      of the neighborhood, and by his precocious intelligence and exceptional
      application, had not been long in getting to the top of his class. The boy
      had left school after gaining an exhibition admitting him to the Chaptal
      College. This hard worker, who was in a fair way of making his own
      position without costing his relatives anything, greatly interested Madame
      Desvarennes. She found in this plucky nature a striking analogy to
      herself. She formed projects for Pierre&rsquo;s future; in fancy she saw him
      enter the Polytechnic school, and leave it with honors. The young man had
      the choice of becoming a mining or civil engineer, and of entering the
      government service.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was hesitating what to do when the mistress came and offered him a
      situation in her firm as junior partner; it was a golden bridge that she
      placed before him. With his exceptional capacities he was not long in
      giving to the house a new impulse. He perfected the machinery, and
      triumphantly defied all competition. All this was a happy dream in which
      Pierre was to her a real son; her home became his, and she monopolized him
      completely. But suddenly a shadow came o&rsquo;er the spirit of her dreams.
      Pierre&rsquo;s mother, the little haberdasher, proud of her son, would she
      consent to give him up to a stranger? Oh! if Pierre had only been an
      orphan! But one could not rob a mother of her son! And Madame Desvarennes
      stopped the flight of her imagination. She followed Pierre with anxious
      looks; but she forbade herself to dispose of the youth: he did not belong
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This woman, at the age of thirty-five, still young in heart, was disturbed
      by feelings which she strove, but vainly, to rule. She hid them especially
      from her husband, whose repining chattering she feared. If she had once
      shown him her weakness he would have overwhelmed her daily with the burden
      of his regrets. But an unforeseen circumstance placed her at Michel&rsquo;s
      mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winter had come, bringing December and its snow. The weather this year was
      exceptionally inclement, and traffic in the streets was so difficult,
      business was almost suspended. The mistress left her deserted offices and
      retired early to her private apartments. The husband and wife spent their
      evenings alone. They sat there, facing each other, at the fireside. A
      shade concentrated the light of the lamp upon the table covered with
      expensive knick-knacks. The ceiling was sometimes vaguely lighted up by a
      glimmer from the stove which glittered on the gilt cornices. Ensconced in
      deep comfortable armchairs, the pair respectively caressed their favorite
      dream without speaking of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes saw beside her a little pink-and-white baby girl,
      toddling on the carpet. She heard her words, understood her language,
      untranslatable to all others than a mother. Then bedtime came. The child,
      with heavy eyelids, let her little fair-haired head fall on her shoulders.
      Madame Desvarennes took her in her arms and undressed her quietly, kissing
      her bare and dimpled arms. It was exquisite enjoyment which stirred her
      heart deliciously. She saw the cradle, and devoured the child with her
      eyes. She knew that the picture was a myth. But what did it matter to her?
      She was happy. Michel&rsquo;s voice broke on her reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wife,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is Christmas Eve; and as there are only us two,
      suppose you put your slipper on the hearth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes rose. Her eyes vaguely turned toward the hearth on
      which the fire was dying, and beside the upright of the large sculptured
      mantelpiece she beheld for a moment a tiny shoe, belonging to the child
      which she loved to see in her dreams. Then the vision vanished, and there
      was nothing left but the lonely hearth. A sharp pain tore her swollen
      heart; a sob rose to her lips, and, slowly, two tears rolled down her
      cheeks. Michel, quite pale, looked at her in silence; he held out his hand
      to her, and said, in a trembling voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were thinking about it, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes bowed her head, twice, silently, and without adding
      another word, the pair fell into each other&rsquo;s arms and wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that day they hid nothing from each other, and shared their troubles
      and regrets in common. The mistress unburdened her heart by making a full
      confession, and Michel, for the first time in his life, learned the depth
      of soul of his companion to its inmost recesses. This woman, so energetic,
      so obstinate, was, as it were, broken down. The springs of her will seemed
      worn out. She felt despondencies and wearinesses until then unknown. Work
      tired her. She did not venture down to the offices; she talked of giving
      up business, which was a bad sign. She longed for country air. Were they
      not rich enough? With their simple tastes so much money was unnecessary.
      In fact, they had no wants. They would go to some pretty estate in the
      suburbs of Paris, live there and plant cabbages. Why work? they had no
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michel agreed to these schemes. For a long time he had wished for repose.
      Often he had feared that his wife&rsquo;s ambition would lead them too far. But
      now, since she stopped of her own accord, it was all for the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture their solicitor informed them that, near to their works,
      the Cernay estate was to be put up for sale. Very often, when going from
      Jouy to the mills, Madame Desvarennes had noticed the chateau, the slate
      roofs of the turrets of which rose gracefully from a mass of deep verdure.
      The Count de Cernay, the last representative of a noble race, had just
      died of consumption, brought on by reckless living, leaving nothing behind
      him but debts and a little girl two years old. Her mother, an Italian
      singer and his mistress, had left him one morning without troubling
      herself about the child. Everything was to be sold, by order of the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some most lamentable incidents had saddened the Count&rsquo;s last hours. The
      bailiffs had entered the house with the doctor when he came to pay his
      last call, and the notices of the sale were all but posted up before the
      funeral was over. Jeanne, the orphan, scared amid the troubles of this
      wretched end, seeing unknown men walking into the reception-rooms with
      their hats on, hearing strangers speaking loudly and with arrogance, had
      taken refuge in the laundry. It was there that Madame Desvarennes found
      her, playing, plainly dressed in a little alpaca frock, her pretty hair
      loose and falling on her shoulders. She looked astonished at what she had
      seen; silent, not daring to run or sing as formerly in the great desolate
      house whence the master had just been taken away forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the vague instinct of abandoned children who seek to attach
      themselves to some one or some thing, Jeanne clung to Madame Desvarennes,
      who, ready to protect, and longing for maternity, took the child in her
      arms. The gardener&rsquo;s wife acted as guide during her visit over the
      property. Madame Desvarennes questioned her. She knew nothing of the child
      except what she had heard from the servants when they gossiped in the
      evenings about their late master. They said Jeanne was a bastard. Of her
      relatives they knew nothing. The Count had an aunt in England who was
      married to a rich lord; but he had not corresponded with her lately. The
      little one then was reduced to beggary as the estate was to be sold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gardener&rsquo;s wife was a good woman and was willing to keep the child
      until the new proprietor came; but when once affairs were settled, she
      would certainly go and make a declaration to the mayor, and take her to
      the workhouse. Madame Desvarennes listened in silence. One word only had
      struck her while the woman was speaking. The child was without support,
      without ties, and abandoned like a poor lost dog. The little one was
      pretty too; and when she fixed her large deep eyes on that improvised
      mother, who pressed her so tenderly to her heart, she seemed to implore
      her not to put her down, and to carry her away from the mourning that
      troubled her mind and the isolation that froze her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes, very superstitious, like a woman of the people, began
      to think that, perhaps, Providence had brought her to Cernay that day and
      had placed the child in her path. It was perhaps a reparation which heaven
      granted her, in giving her the little girl she so longed for. Acting
      unhesitatingly, as she did in everything, she left her name with the
      woman, carried Jeanne to her carriage, and took her to Paris, promising
      herself to make inquiries to find her relatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      A month later, the property of Cernay pleasing her, and the researches for
      Jeanne&rsquo;s friends not proving successful, Madame Desvarennes took
      possession of the estate and the child into the bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michel welcomed the child without enthusiasm. The little stranger was
      indifferent to him; he would have preferred adopting a boy. The mistress
      was delighted. Her maternal instincts, so long stifled, developed fully.
      She made plans for the future. Her energy returned; she spoke loudly and
      firmly. But in her appearance there was revealed an inward contentment
      never remarked before, which made her sweeter and more benevolent. She no
      longer spoke of retiring from business. The discouragement which had
      seized her left her as if by magic. The house which had been so dull for
      some months became noisy and gay. The child, like a sunbeam, had scattered
      the clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that the most unlooked-for phenomenon, which was so
      considerably to influence Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s life, occurred. At the
      moment when the mistress seemed provided by chance with the heiress so
      much longed for, she learned with surprise that she was about to become a
      mother! After sixteen years of married life, this discovery was almost a
      discomfiture. What would have been delight formerly was now a cause for
      fear. She, almost an old woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an incredible commotion in the business world when the news
      became known. The younger branch of Desvarennes had witnessed Jeanne&rsquo;s
      arrival with little satisfaction, and were still more gloomy when they
      learned that the chances of their succeeding to great wealth were over.
      Still they did not lose all hopes. At thirty-five years of age one cannot
      always tell how these little affairs will come off. An accident was
      possible. But none occurred; all passed off well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes was as strong physically as she was morally, and proved
      victorious by bringing into the world a little girl, who was named
      Micheline in honor of her father. The mistress&rsquo;s heart was large enough to
      hold two children; she kept the orphan she had adopted, and brought her up
      as if she had been her very own. Still there was soon an enormous
      difference in her manner of loving Jeanne and Micheline. This mother had
      for the long-wished-for child an ardent, mad, passionate love like that of
      a tigress for her cubs. She had never loved her husband. All the
      tenderness which had accumulated in her heart blossomed, and it was like
      spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      This autocrat, who had never allowed contradiction, and before whom all
      her dependents bowed either with or against the grain, was now led in her
      turn; the bronze of her character became like wax in the little pink hands
      of her daughter. The commanding woman bent before the little fair head.
      There was nothing good enough for Micheline. Had the mother owned the
      world she would have placed it at the little one&rsquo;s feet. One tear from the
      child upset her. If on one of the most important subjects Madame
      Desvarennes had said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Micheline came and said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the hitherto
      resolute will became subordinate to the caprice of a child. They knew it
      in the house and acted upon it. This manoeuvre succeeded each time,
      although Madame Desvarennes had seen through it from the first. It
      appeared as if the mother felt a secret joy in proving under all
      circumstances the unbounded adoration which she felt for her daughter. She
      often said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty as she is, and rich as I shall make her, what husband will be
      worthy of Micheline? But if she believes me when it is time to choose one,
      she will prefer a man remarkable for his intelligence, and will give him
      her fortune as a stepping-stone to raise him as high as she chooses him to
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inwardly she was thinking of Pierre Delarue, who had just taken honors at
      the Polytechnic school, and who seemed to have a brilliant career before
      him. This woman, humbly born, was proud of her origin, and sought a
      plebeian for her son-in-law, to put into his hand a golden tool powerful
      enough to move the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Micheline was ten years old when her father died. Alas, Michel was not a
      great loss. They wore mourning for him; but they hardly noticed that he
      was absent. His whole life had been a void. Madame Desvarennes, it is sad
      to say, felt herself more mistress of her child when she was a widow. She
      was jealous of Micheline&rsquo;s affections, and each kiss the child gave her
      father seemed to the mother to be robbed from her. With this fierce
      tenderness, she preferred solitude around this beloved being.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time Madame Desvarennes was really in the zenith of womanly
      splendor. She seemed taller, her figure had straightened, vigorous and
      powerful. Her gray hair gave her face a majestic appearance. Always
      surrounded by a court of clients and friends, she seemed like a sovereign.
      The fortune of the firm was not to be computed. It was said Madame
      Desvarennes did not know how rich she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne and Micheline grew up amid this colossal prosperity. The one, tall,
      brown-haired, with blue eyes changing like the sea; the other, fragile,
      fair, with dark dreamy eyes. Jeanne, proud, capricious, and inconstant;
      Micheline, simple, sweet, and tenacious. The brunette inherited from her
      reckless father and her fanciful mother a violent and passionate nature;
      the blonde was tractable and good like Michel, but resolute and firm like
      Madame Desvarennes. These two opposite natures were congenial, Micheline
      sincerely loving Jeanne, and Jeanne feeling the necessity of living
      amicably with Micheline, her mother&rsquo;s idol, but inwardly enduring with
      difficulty the inequalities which began to exhibit themselves in the
      manner with which the intimates of the house treated the one and the
      other. She found these flatteries wounding, and thought Madame
      Desvarennes&rsquo;s preferences for Micheline unjust.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these accumulated grievances made Jeanne conceive the wish one morning
      of leaving the house where she had been brought up, and where she now felt
      humiliated. Pretending to long to go to England to see that rich relative
      of her father, who, knowing her to be in a brilliant society, had taken
      notice of her, she asked Madame Desvarennes to allow her to spend a few
      weeks from home. She wished to try the ground in England, and see what she
      might expect in the future from her family. Madame Desvarennes lent
      herself to this whim, not guessing the young girl&rsquo;s real motive; and
      Jeanne, well attended, went to her aunt&rsquo;s home in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes, besides, had attained the summit of her hopes, and an
      event had just taken place which preoccupied her. Micheline, deferring to
      her mother&rsquo;s wishes, had decided to allow herself to be betrothed to
      Pierre Delarue, who had just lost his mother, and whose business improved
      daily. The young girl, accustomed to treat Pierre like a brother, had
      easily consented to accept him as her future husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne, who had been away for six months, had returned sobered and
      disillusioned about her family. She had found them kind and affable, had
      received many compliments on her beauty, which was really remarkable, but
      had not met with any encouragement in her desires for independence. She
      came home resolved not to leave until she married. She arrived in the Rue
      Saint-Dominique at the moment when Pierre Delarue, thirsting with
      ambition, was leaving his betrothed, his relatives, and gay Paris to
      undertake engineering work on the coasts of Algeria and Tunis that would
      raise him above his rivals. In leaving, the young man did not for a moment
      think that Jeanne was returning from England at the same hour with trouble
      for him in the person of a very handsome cavalier, Prince Serge Panine,
      who had been introduced to her at a ball during the London season.
      Mademoiselle de Cernay, availing herself of English liberty, was returning
      escorted only by a maid in company with the Prince. The journey had been
      delightful. The tete-a-tete travelling had pleased the young people, and
      on leaving the train they had promised to see each other again. Official
      balls facilitated their meeting; Serge was introduced to Madame
      Desvarennes as being an English friend, and soon became the most assiduous
      partner of Jeanne and Micheline. It was thus, under the most trivial
      pretext, that the man gained admittance to the house where he was to play
      such an important part.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. THE GALLEY-SLAVE OF PLEASURE
    </h2>
    <p>
      One morning in the month of May, 1879, a young man, elegantly attired,
      alighted from a well-appointed carriage before the door of Madame
      Desvarennes&rsquo;s house. The young man passed quickly before the porter in
      uniform, decorated with a military medal, stationed near the door. The
      visitor found himself in an anteroom which communicated with several
      corridors. A messenger was seated in the depth of a large armchair,
      reading the newspaper, and not even lending an inattentive ear to the
      whispered conversation of a dozen canvassers, who were patiently awaiting
      their turn for gaining a hearing. On seeing the young man enter by the
      private door, the messenger rose, dropped his newspaper on the armchair,
      hastily raised his velvet skullcap, tried to smile, and made two steps
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, old Felix,&rdquo; said the young man, in a friendly tone to the
      messenger. &ldquo;Is my aunt within?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Monsieur Savinien, Madame Desvarennes is in her office; but she has
      been engaged for more than an hour with the Financial Secretary of the War
      Department.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In uttering these words old Felix put on a mysterious and important air,
      which denoted how serious the discussions going on in the adjoining room
      seemed to his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; continued he, showing Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s nephew the anteroom
      full of people, &ldquo;madame has kept all these waiting since this morning, and
      perhaps she won&rsquo;t see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must see her though,&rdquo; murmured the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reflected a moment, then added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Monsieur Marechal in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, certainly. If you will allow me I will announce you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is unnecessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, stepping forward, he entered the office adjoining that of Madame
      Desvarennes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated at a large table of black wood, covered with bundles of papers and
      notes, a young man was working. He was thirty years of age, but appeared
      much older. His prematurely bald forehead, and wrinkled brow, betokened a
      life of severe struggles and privations, or a life of excesses and
      pleasures. Still those clear and pure eyes were not those of a libertine,
      and the straight nose solidly joined to the face was that of a searcher.
      Whatever the cause, the man was old before his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing the door of his office open, he raised his eyes, put down his
      pen, and was making a movement toward his visitor, when the latter
      interrupted him quickly with these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stir, Marechal, or I shall be off! I only came in until Aunt
      Desvarennes is at liberty; but if I disturb you I will go and take a turn,
      smoke a cigar, and come back in three quarters of an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not disturb me, Monsieur Savinien; at least not often enough, for
      be it said, without reproaching you, it is more than three months since we
      have seen anything of you. There, the post is finished. I was writing the
      last addresses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And taking a heavy bundle of papers off the desk, Marechal showed them to
      Savinien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious! It seems that business is going on well here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better and better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are making mountains of flour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; high as Mont Blanc; and then, we now have a fleet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! a fleet?&rdquo; cried Savinien, whose face expressed doubt and surprise
      at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a steam fleet. Last year Madame Desvarennes was not satisfied with
      the state in which her corn came from the East. The corn was damaged owing
      to defective stowage; the firm claimed compensation from the steamship
      company. The claim was only moderately satisfied, Madame Desvarennes got
      vexed, and now we import our own. We have branches at Smyrna and Odessa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is fabulous! If it goes on, my aunt will have an administration as
      important as that of a European state. Oh! you are happy here, you people;
      you are busy. I amuse myself! And if you knew how it wearies me! I am
      withering, consuming myself, I am longing for business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And saying these words, young Monsieur Desvarennes allowed a sorrowful
      moan to escape him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Marechal, &ldquo;that it only depends upon yourself to do
      as much and more business than any one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know well enough that it is not so,&rdquo; sighed Savinien; &ldquo;my aunt is
      opposed to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a mistake!&rdquo; cried Marechal, quickly. &ldquo;I have heard Madame
      Desvarennes say more than twenty times how she regretted your being
      unemployed. Come into the firm, you will have a good berth in the
      counting-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the counting-house!&rdquo; cried Savinien, bitterly; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s the sore
      point. Now look here; my friend, do you think that an organization like
      mine is made to bend to the trivialities of a copying clerk&rsquo;s work? To
      follow the humdrum of every-day routine? To blacken paper? To become a
      servant?&mdash;me! with what I have in my brain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, rising abruptly, Savinien began to walk hurriedly up and down the
      room, disdainfully shaking his little head with its low forehead on which
      were plastered a few fair curls (made with curling-irons), with the
      indignant air of an Atlas carrying the world on his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know very well what is at the bottom of the business&mdash;my aunt
      is jealous of me because I am a man of ideas. She wishes to be the only
      one of the family who possesses any. She thinks of binding me down to a
      besotting work,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;but I won&rsquo;t have it. I know what I want!
      It is independence of thought, bent on the solution of great problems&mdash;that
      is, a wide field to apply my discoveries. But a fixed rule, common law, I
      could not submit to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is like the examinations,&rdquo; observed Marechal, looking slyly at young
      Desvarennes, who was drawing himself up to his full height; &ldquo;examinations
      never suited you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Savinien, energetically. &ldquo;They wished to get me into the
      Polytechnic School; impossible! Then the Central School; no better. I
      astonished the examiners by the novelty of my ideas. They refused me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know,&rdquo; retorted Marechal, &ldquo;if you began by overthrowing their
      theories&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; cried Savinien, triumphantly. &ldquo;My mind is stronger than I; I
      must let my imagination have free run, and no one will ever know what that
      particular turn of mind has cost me. Even my family do not think me
      serious. Aunt Desvarennes has forbidden any kind of enterprise, under
      pretence that I bear her name, and that I might compromise it because I
      have twice failed. My aunt paid, it is true. Do you think it is generous
      of her to take advantage of my situation, and prohibit my trying to
      succeed? Are inventors judged by three or four failures? If my aunt had
      allowed me I should have astonished the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She feared, above all,&rdquo; said Marechal, simply, &ldquo;to see you astonishing
      the Tribunal of Commerce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you, too,&rdquo; moaned Savinien, &ldquo;are in league with my enemies; you make
      no account of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And young Desvarennes sank as if crushed into an armchair and began to
      lament. He was very unhappy at being misunderstood. His aunt allowed him
      three thousand francs a month on condition that he would not make use of
      his ten fingers. Was it moral? Then he with such exuberant vigor had to
      waste it on pleasure and seeing life to the utmost. He passed his time in
      theatres, at clubs, restaurants, in boudoirs. He lost his time, his money,
      his hair, his illusions. He bemoaned his lot, but continued, only to have
      something to do. With grim sarcasm he called himself the galley-slave of
      pleasure. And notwithstanding all these consuming excesses, he asserted
      that he could not render his imagination barren. Amid the greatest follies
      at suppers, during the clinking of glasses; in the excitement of the
      dance-inspirations came to him in flashes, he made prodigious discoveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as Marechal ventured a timid &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; tinged with incredulity, Savinien
      flew into a passion. Yes; he had invented something astonishing; he saw
      fortune within reach, and he thought the bargain made with his aunt very
      unjust. Therefore he had come to break it, and to regain his liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marechal looked at the young man while he was explaining with animation
      his ambitious projects. He scrutinized that flat forehead within which the
      dandy asserted so many good ideas were hidden. He measured that slim form
      bent by wild living, and asked himself how that degenerate being could
      struggle against the difficulties of business. A smile played on his lips.
      He knew Savinien too well not to be aware that he was a prey to one of
      those attacks of melancholy which seized on him when his funds were low.
    </p>
    <p>
      On these occasions, which occurred frequently, the young man had longings
      for business, which Madame Desvarennes stopped by asking: &ldquo;How much?&rdquo;
       Savinien allowed himself to be with difficulty induced to consent to
      renounce the certain profits promised, as he said, by his projected
      enterprise. At last he would capitulate, and with his pocket well lined,
      nimble and joyful, he returned to his boudoirs, race-courses, fashionable
      restaurants, and became more than ever the galley-slave of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Pierre?&rdquo; asked young Desvarennes, suddenly and quickly changing the
      subject. &ldquo;Have you any news of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marechal became serious. A cloud seemed to have come across his brow; he
      gravely answered Savinien&rsquo;s question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre was still in the East. He was travelling toward Tunis, the coast of
      which he was exploring. It was a question of the formation of an inland
      sea by taking the water through the desert. It would be a colossal
      undertaking, the results of which would be considerable as regarded
      Algeria. The climate would be completely changed, and the value of the
      colony would be increased tenfold, because it would become the most
      fertile country in the world. Pierre had been occupied in this undertaking
      for more than a year with unequalled ardor; he was far from his home, his
      betrothed, seeing only the goal to be attained; turning a deaf ear to all
      that would distract his attention from the great work, to the success of
      which he hoped to contribute gloriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t people say,&rdquo; resumed Savinien with an evil smile, &ldquo;that during
      his absence a dashing young fellow is busy luring his betrothed away from
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words Marechal made a quick movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is false,&rdquo; he interrupted; &ldquo;and I do not understand how you, Monsieur
      Desvarennes, should be the bearer of such a tale. To admit that
      Mademoiselle Micheline could break her word or her engagements is to
      slander her, and if any one other than you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, my dear friend,&rdquo; said Savinien, laughing, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t get into a
      rage. What I say to you I would not repeat to the first comer; besides, I
      am only the echo of a rumor that has been going the round during the last
      three weeks. They even give the name of him who has been chosen for the
      honor and pleasure of such a brilliant conquest. I mean Prince Serge
      Panine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you have mentioned Prince Panine,&rdquo; replied Marechal, &ldquo;allow me to tell
      you that he has not put his foot inside Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s door for
      three weeks. This is not the way of a man about to marry the daughter of
      the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, I only repeat what I have heard. As for me, I don&rsquo;t know
      any more. I have kept out of the way for more than three months. And
      besides, it matters little to me whether Micheline be a commoner or a
      princess, the wife of Delarue or of Panine. I shall be none the richer or
      the poorer, shall I? Therefore I need not care. The dear child will
      certainly have millions enough to marry easily. And her adopted sister,
      the stately Mademoiselle Jeanne, what has become of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! as to Mademoiselle de Cernay, that is another affair,&rdquo; cried
      Marechal.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as if wishing to divert the conversation in an opposite direction to
      which Savinien had led it a moment before, he spoke readily of Madame
      Desvarennes&rsquo;s adopted daughter. She had made a lively impression on one of
      the intimate friends of the house&mdash;the banker Cayrol, who had offered
      his name and his fortune to the fair Jeanne.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a cause of deep amazement to Savinien. What! Cayrol! The shrewd
      close&mdash;fisted Auvergnat! A girl without a fortune! Cayrol Silex as he
      was called in the commercial world on account of his hardness. This living
      money-bag had a heart then! It was necessary to believe it since both
      money-bag and heart had been placed at Mademoiselle de Cernay&rsquo;s feet. This
      strange girl was certainly destined to millions. She had just missed being
      Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s heiress, and now Cayrol had taken it into his head to
      marry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that was not all. And when Marechal told Savinien that the fair Jeanne
      flatly refused to become the wife of Cayrol, there was an outburst of
      joyful exclamations. She refused! By Jove, she was mad! An unlooked-for
      marriage&mdash;for she had not a penny, and had most extravagant notions.
      She had been brought up as if she were to live always in velvet and silks&mdash;to
      loll in carriages and think only of her pleasure. What reason did she give
      for refusing him! None. Haughtily and disdainfully she had declared that
      she did not love &ldquo;that man,&rdquo; and that she would not marry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Savinien heard these details his rapture increased. One thing
      especially charmed him: Jeanne&rsquo;s saying &ldquo;that man,&rdquo; when speaking of
      Cayrol. A little girl who was called &ldquo;De Cernay&rdquo; just as he might call
      himself &ldquo;Des Batignolles&rdquo; if he pleased: the natural and unacknowledged
      daughter of a Count and of a shady public singer! And she refused Cayrol,
      calling him &ldquo;that man.&rdquo; It was really funny. And what did worthy Cayrol
      say about it?
    </p>
    <p>
      When Marechal declared that the banker had not been damped by this
      discouraging reception, Savinien said it was human nature. The fair Jeanne
      scorned Cayrol and Cayrol adored her. He had often seen those things
      happen. He knew the baggages so well! Nobody knew more of women than he
      did. He had known some more difficult to manage than proud Mademoiselle
      Jeanne.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old leaven of hatred had festered in Savinien&rsquo;s heart against Jeanne
      since the time when the younger branch of the Desvarennes had reason to
      fear that the superb heritage was going to the adopted daughter. Savinien
      had lost the fear, but had kept up the animosity. And everything that
      could happen to Jeanne of a vexing or painful nature would be witnessed by
      him with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to encourage Marechal to continue his revelations, and had
      risen and was leaning on the desk. With his face excited and eager, he was
      preparing his question, when, through the door which led to Madame
      Desvarennes&rsquo;s office, a confused murmur of voices was heard. At the same
      time the door was half opened, held by a woman&rsquo;s hand, square, with short
      fingers, a firm-willed and energetic hand. At the same time, the last
      words exchanged between Madame Desvarennes and the Financial Secretary of
      the War Office were distinctly audible. Madame Desvarennes was speaking,
      and her voice sounded clear and plain; a little raised and vibrating.
      There seemed a shade of anger in its tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, you will tell the Minister that does not suit me. It is not
      the custom of the house. For thirty-five years I have conducted business
      thus, and I have always found it answer. I wish you good-morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door of the office facing that which Madame Desvarennes held closed,
      and a light step glided along the corridor. It was the Financial
      Secretary&rsquo;s. The mistress appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marechal rose hastily. As to Savinien, all his resolution seemed to have
      vanished at the sound of his aunt&rsquo;s voice, for he had rapidly gained a
      corner of the room, and seated himself on a leather-covered sofa, hidden
      behind an armchair, where he remained perfectly quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you understand that, Marechal?&rdquo; said dame Desvarennes; &ldquo;they want to
      place a resident agent at the mill on pretext of checking things. They say
      that all military contractors are obliged to submit to it. My word, do
      they take us for thieves, the rascals? It is the first time that people
      have seemed to doubt me. And it has enraged me. I have been arguing for a
      whole hour with the man they sent me. I said to him, &lsquo;My dear sir, you may
      either take it or leave it. Let us start from this point: I can do without
      you and you cannot do without me. If you don&rsquo;t buy my flour, somebody else
      will. I am not at all troubled about it. But as to having any one here who
      would be as much master as myself, or perhaps more, never! I am too old to
      change my customs.&rsquo; Thereupon the Financial Secretary left. There! And,
      besides, they change their Ministry every fortnight. One would never know
      with whom one had to deal. Thank you, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While talking thus with Marechal, Madame Desvarennes was walking about the
      office. She was still the same woman with the broad prominent forehead.
      Her hair, which she wore in smooth plaits, had become gray, but the
      sparkle of her dark eyes only seemed the brighter from this. She had
      preserved her splendid teeth, and her smile had remained young and
      charming. She spoke with animation, as usual, and with the gestures of a
      man. She placed herself before her secretary, seeming to appeal to him as
      a witness of her being in the right. During the hour with the official
      personage she had been obliged to contain herself. She unburdened herself
      to Marechal, saying just what she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all at once she perceived Savinien, who was waiting to show himself
      now that she had finished. The mistress turned sharply to the young man,
      and frowned slightly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo! you are there, eh? How is it that you could leave your fair
      friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, aunt, I came to pay you my respects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No nonsense now; I&rsquo;ve no time,&rdquo; interrupted the mistress. &ldquo;What do you
      want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Savinien, disconcerted by this rude reception, blinked his eyes, as if
      seeking some form to give his request; then, making up his mind, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to see you on business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You on business?&rdquo; replied Madame Desvarennes, with a shade of
      astonishment and irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, aunt, on business,&rdquo; declared Savinien, looking down as if he
      expected a rebuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh!&rdquo; said Madame Desvarennes, &ldquo;you know our agreement; I give you
      an allowance&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I renounce my income,&rdquo; interrupted Savinien, quickly, &ldquo;I wish to take
      back my independence. The transfer I made has already cost me too dear.
      It&rsquo;s a fool&rsquo;s bargain. The enterprise which I am going to launch is
      superb, and must realize immense profits. I shall certainly not abandon
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While speaking, Savinien had become animated and had regained his
      self-possession. He believed in his scheme, and was ready to pledge his
      future. He argued that his aunt could not blame him for giving proof of
      his energy and daring, and he discoursed in bombastic style.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; cried Madame Desvarennes, interrupting her nephew&rsquo;s
      oration. &ldquo;I am very fond of mills, but not word-mills. You are talking too
      much about it to be sincere. So many words can only serve to disguise the
      nullity of your projects. You want to embark in speculation? With what
      money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I contribute the scheme and some capitalists will advance the money to
      start with; we shall then issue shares!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never in this life! I oppose it. You! With a responsibility. You!
      Directing an undertaking. You would only commit absurdities. In fact, you
      want to sell an idea, eh? Well, I will buy it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not only the money I want,&rdquo; said Savinien, with an indignant air,
      &ldquo;it is confidence in my ideas, it is enthusiasm on the part of my
      shareholders, it is success. You don&rsquo;t believe in my ideas, aunt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it matter to you, if I buy them from you? It seems to me a
      pretty good proof of confidence. Is that settled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, aunt, you are implacable!&rdquo; groaned Savinien. &ldquo;When you have laid your
      hand upon any one, it is all over. Adieu, independence; one must obey you.
      Nevertheless, it was a vast and beautiful conception.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Marechal, see that my nephew has ten thousand francs. And you,
      Savinien, remember that I see no more of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until the money is spent!&rdquo; murmured Marechal, in the ear of Madame
      Desvarennes&rsquo;s nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      And taking him by the arm he was leading him toward the safe when the
      mistress turned to Savinien and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, what is your invention?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt, it is a threshing machine,&rdquo; answered the young man, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather a machine for coining money,&rdquo; said the incorrigible Marechal, in
      an undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; bring me your plans,&rdquo; resumed Madame Desvarennes, after having
      reflected a moment. &ldquo;Perchance you may have hit upon something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mistress had been generous, and now the woman of business reasserted
      herself and she thought of reaping the benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Savinien seemed very confused at this demand, and as his aunt gave him an
      interrogative look, he confessed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no drawings made as yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No drawings as yet?&rdquo; cried the mistress. &ldquo;Where then is your invention?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is here,&rdquo; replied Savinien, and with an inspired gesture he struck his
      narrow forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes and Marechal could not resist breaking out into a
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you were already talking of issuing shares?&rdquo; said the mistress. &ldquo;Do
      you think people would have paid their money with your brain as sole
      guarantee? You! Get along; I am the only one to make bargains like that,
      and you are the only one with whom I make them. Go, Marechal, give him his
      money; I won&rsquo;t gainsay it. But you are a trickster, as usual!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. PIERRE RETURNS
    </h2>
    <p>
      By a wave of her hand she dismissed Savinien, who, abashed, went out with
      Marechal. Left alone, she seated herself at her secretary&rsquo;s desk, and
      taking the pile of letters she signed them. The pen flew in her fingers,
      and on the paper was displayed her name, written in large letters in a
      man&rsquo;s handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been occupied thus for about a quarter of an hour when Marechal
      reappeared. Behind him came a stout thickset man of heavy build, and
      gorgeously dressed. His face, surrounded by a bristly dark brown beard,
      and his eyes overhung by bushy eyebrows, gave him, at the first glance, a
      harsh appearance. But his mouth promptly banished this impression. His
      thick and sensual lips betrayed voluptuous tastes. A disciple of Lavater
      or Gall would have found the bump of amativeness largely developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marechal stepped aside to allow him to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, mistress,&rdquo; said he familiarly, approaching Madame
      Desvarennes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mistress raised her head quickly, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it&rsquo;s you, Cayrol! That&rsquo;s capital! I was just going to send for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jean Cayrol, a native of Cantal, had been brought up amid the wild
      mountains of Auvergne. His father was a small farmer in the neighborhood
      of Saint-Flour, scraping a miserable pittance from the ground for the
      maintenance of his family. From the age of eight years Cayrol had been a
      shepherd-boy. Alone in the quiet and remote country, the child had given
      way to ambitious dreams. He was very intelligent, and felt that he was
      born to another sphere than that of farming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, at the first opportunity which had occurred to take him into a town,
      he was found ready. He went as servant to a banker at Brioude. There, in
      the service of this comparatively luxurious house, he got smoothed down a
      little, and lost some of his clumsy loutishness. Strong as an ox, he did
      the work of two men, and at night, when in his garret, fell asleep
      learning to read. He was seized by the ambition to get on. No pains were
      to be spared to gain his goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      His master having been elected a member of the Chamber of Deputies, Cayrol
      accompanied him to Paris. Life in the capital finished the turmoil of
      Cayrol&rsquo;s brain. Seeing the prodigious activity of the great city on whose
      pavements fortunes sprang up in a day like mushrooms, the Auvergnat felt
      his moral strength equal to the occasion, and leaving his master, he
      became clerk to a merchant in the Rue du Sentier.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, for four years, he studied commerce, and gained much experience. He
      soon learned that it was only in financial transactions that large
      fortunes were to be rapidly made. He left the Rue du Sentier, and found a
      place at a stock-broker&rsquo;s. His keen scent for speculation served him
      admirably. After the lapse of a few years he had charge of the business.
      His position was getting better; he was making fifteen thousand francs per
      annum, but that was nothing compared to his dreams. He was then
      twenty-eight years of age. He felt ready to do anything to succeed, except
      something unhandsome, for this lover of money would have died rather than
      enrich himself by dishonest means.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this time that his lucky star threw him in Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s
      way. The mistress, understanding men, guessed Cayrol&rsquo;s worth quickly. She
      was seeking a banker who would devote himself to her interests. She
      watched the young man narrowly for some time; then, sure she was not
      mistaken as to his capacity, she bluntly proposed to give him money to
      start a business. Cayrol, who had already saved eighty thousand francs,
      received twelve hundred thousand from Madame Desvarennes, and settled in
      the Rue Taitbout, two steps from the house of Rothschild.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes had made a lucky hit in choosing Cayrol as her
      confidential agent. This short, thickset Auvergnat was a master of
      finance, and in a few years had raised the house to an unexpected degree
      of prosperity. Madame Desvarennes had drawn considerable sums as interest
      on the money lent, and the banker&rsquo;s fortune was already estimated at
      several millions. Was it the happy influence of Madame Desvarennes that
      changed everything she touched into gold, or were Cayrol&rsquo;s capacities
      really extraordinary? The results were there and that was sufficient. They
      did not trouble themselves over and above that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The banker had naturally become one of the intimates of Madame
      Desvarennes&rsquo;s house. For a long time he saw Jeanne without particularly
      noticing her. This young girl had not struck his fancy. It was one night
      at a ball, on seeing her dancing with Prince Panine, that he perceived
      that she was marvellously engaging. His eyes were attracted by an
      invincible power and followed her graceful figure whirling through the
      waltz. He secretly envied the brilliant cavalier who was holding this
      adorable creature in his arms, who was bending over her bare shoulders,
      and whose breath lightly touched her hair. He longed madly for Jeanne, and
      from that moment thought only of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince was then very friendly with Mademoiselle de Cernay; he
      overwhelmed her with kind attentions. Cayrol watched him to see if he
      spoke to her of love, but Panine was a past master in these drawing-room
      skirmishes, and the banker got nothing for his pains. That Cayrol was
      tenacious has been proved. He became intimate with the Prince. He tendered
      him such little services as create intimacy, and when he was sure of not
      being repulsed with haughtiness, he questioned Serge. Did he love
      Mademoiselle de Cernay? This question, asked in a trembling voice and with
      a constrained smile, found the Prince quite calm. He answered lightly that
      Mademoiselle de Cernay was a very agreeable partner, but that he had never
      dreamed of offering her his homage. He had other projects in his head.
      Cayrol pressed the Prince&rsquo;s hand violently, made a thousand protestations
      of devotedness, and finally obtained his complete confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge loved Mademoiselle Desvarennes, and it was to become intimate with
      her that he had so eagerly sought her friend&rsquo;s company. Cayrol, in
      learning the Prince&rsquo;s secret, resumed his usual reserved manner. He knew
      that Micheline was engaged to Pierre Delarue, but still, women were so
      whimsical! Who could tell? Perhaps Mademoiselle Desvarennes had looked
      favorably upon the handsome Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was really admirable to view, this Panine, with his blue eyes, pure as
      a maiden&rsquo;s, and his long fair mustache falling on each side of his rosy
      mouth. He had a truly royal bearing, and was descended from an ancient
      aristocratic race; he had a charming hand and an arched foot, enough to
      make a woman envious. Soft and insinuating with his tender voice and sweet
      Sclavonic accent, he was no ordinary man, but one usually creating a great
      impression wherever he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      His story was well known in Paris. He was born in the province of Posen,
      so violently seized on by Prussia, that octopus of Europe. Serge&rsquo;s father
      had been killed during the insurrection of 1848, and he, when a year old,
      was brought by his uncle, Thaddeus Panine, to France, and was educated at
      the College Rollin, where he had not acquired over much learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1866, at the moment when war broke out between Prussia and Austria,
      Serge was eighteen years old. By his uncle&rsquo;s orders he had left Paris, and
      had entered himself for the campaign in an Austrian cavalry regiment. All
      who bore the name of Panine, and had strength to hold a sword or carry a
      gun, had risen to fight the oppressor of Poland. Serge, during this short
      and bloody struggle, showed prodigies of valor. On the night of Sadowa,
      out of seven bearing the name of Panine, who had served against Prussia,
      five were dead, one was wounded; Serge alone was untouched, though red
      with the blood of his uncle Thaddeus, who was killed by the bursting of a
      shell. All these Panines, living or dead, had gained honors. When they
      were spoken of before Austrians or Poles, they were called heroes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a man was a dangerous companion for a young, simple, and artless girl
      like Micheline. His adventures were bound to please her imagination, and
      his beauty sure to charm her eyes. Cayrol was a prudent man; he watched,
      and it was not long before he perceived that Micheline treated the Prince
      with marked favor. The quiet young girl became animated when Serge was
      there. Was there love in this transformation? Cayrol did not hesitate. He
      guessed at once that the future would be Panine&rsquo;s, and that the
      maintenance of his own influence in the house of Desvarennes depended on
      the attitude which he was about to take. He passed over to the side of the
      newcomer with arms and baggage, and placed himself entirely at his
      disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was he who three weeks before, in the name of Panine, had made
      overtures to Madame Desvarennes. The errand had been difficult, and the
      banker had turned his tongue several times in his mouth before speaking.
      Still, Cayrol could overcome all difficulties. He was able to explain the
      object of his mission without Madame flying into a passion. But, the
      explanation over, there was a terrible scene. He witnessed one of the most
      awful bursts of rage that it was possible to expect from a violent woman.
      The mistress treated the friend of the family as one would not have dared
      to treat a petty commercial traveller who came to a private house to offer
      his wares. She showed him the door, and desired him not to darken the
      threshold again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if Cayrol was resolute he was equally patient. He listened without
      saying a word to the reproaches of Madame Desvarennes, who was exasperated
      that a candidate should be set up in opposition to the son-in-law of her
      choosing. He did not go, and when Madame Desvarennes was a little calmed
      by the letting out of her indignation, he argued with her. The mistress
      was too hasty about the business; it was no use deciding without
      reflecting. Certainly, nobody esteemed Pierre Delarue more than he did;
      but it was necessary to know whether Micheline loved him. A childish
      affection was not love, and Prince Panine thought he might hope that
      Mademoiselle Desvarennes&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The mistress did not allow Cayrol to finish his sentence; she rang the
      bell and asked for her daughter. This time, Cayrol prudently took the
      opportunity of disappearing. He had opened fire; it was for Micheline to
      decide the result of the battle. The banker awaited the issue of the
      interview between mother and daughter in the next room. Through the door
      he heard the irritated tones of Madame Desvarennes, to which Micheline
      answered softly and slowly. The mother threatened and stormed. Coldly and
      quietly the daughter received the attack. The tussle lasted about an hour,
      when the door reopened and Madame Desvarennes appeared, pale and still
      trembling, but calmed. Micheline, wiping her beautiful eyes, still wet
      with tears, regained her apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Cayrol timidly, seeing the mistress standing silent and
      absorbed before him; &ldquo;I see with pleasure that you are less agitated. Did
      Mademoiselle Micheline give you good reasons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good reasons!&rdquo; cried Madame Desvarennes with a violent gesture, last
      flash of the late storm. &ldquo;She cried, that&rsquo;s all. And you know when she
      cries I no longer know what I do or say! She breaks my heart with her
      tears. And she knows it. Ah! it is a great misfortune to love children too
      much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This energetic woman was conquered, and yet understood that she was wrong
      to allow herself to be conquered. She fell into a deep reverie, and forgot
      that Cayrol was present. She thought of the future which she had planned
      for Micheline, and which the latter carelessly destroyed in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre, now an orphan, would have been a real son to the mistress. He
      would have lived in her house, and have surrounded her old age with care
      and affection. And then, he was so full of ability that he could not help
      attaining a brilliant position. She would have helped him, and would have
      rejoiced in his success. And all this scaffolding was overturned because
      this Panine had crossed Micheline&rsquo;s path. A foreign adventurer, prince
      perhaps, but who could tell? Lies are easily told when the proofs of the
      lie have to be sought beyond the frontiers. And it was her daughter who
      was going to fall in love with an insipid fop who only coveted her
      millions. That she should see such a man enter her family, steal
      Micheline&rsquo;s love from her, and rummage her strongbox! In a moment she
      vowed mortal hatred against Panine, and resolved to do all she could to
      prevent the longed-for marriage with her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was disturbed in her meditation by Cayrol&rsquo;s voice. He wished to take
      an answer to the Prince. What must he say to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will let him know,&rdquo; said Madame Desvarennes, &ldquo;that he must refrain
      from seeking opportunities of meeting my daughter. If he be a gentleman,
      he will understand that his presence, even in Paris, is disagreeable to
      me. I ask him to go away for three weeks. After that time he may come
      back, and I agree to give him an answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promise me that you will not be vexed with me for having undertaken
      this errand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise on one condition. It is, that not a word which has passed here
      this morning shall be repeated to any one. Nobody must suspect the
      proposal that you have just made to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol swore to hold his tongue, and he kept his word. Prince Panine left
      that same night for England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes was a woman of quick resolution. She took a sheet of
      paper, a pen, and in her large handwriting wrote the following lines
      addressed to Pierre:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do not wish to find Micheline married on your return, come back
      without a moment&rsquo;s delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sent this ominous letter to the young man, who was then in Tripoli.
      That done, she returned to her business as if nothing had happened. Her
      placid face did not once betray the anguish of her heart during those
      three weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term fixed by Madame Desvarennes with the Prince had expired that
      morning. And the severity with which the mistress had received the
      Minister of War&rsquo;s Financial Secretary was a symptom of the agitation in
      which the necessity of coming to a decision placed Micheline&rsquo;s mother.
      Every morning for the last week she had expected Pierre to arrive. What
      with having to give an answer to the Prince as she had promised, and the
      longing to see him whom she loved as a son, she felt sick at heart and
      utterly cast down. She thought of asking the Prince for a respite. It was
      for that reason she was glad to see Cayrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter, therefore, had arrived opportunely. He looked as if he brought
      startling news. By a glance he drew Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s attention to
      Marechal and seemed to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be alone with you; send him away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mistress understood, and with a decided gesture said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can speak before Marechal; he knows all my affairs as well as I do
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even the matter that brings me here?&rdquo; replied Cayrol, with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even that. It was necessary for me to have some one to whom I could
      speak, or else my heart would have burst! Come, do your errand. The
      Prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lot it has to do with the Prince,&rdquo; exclaimed Cayrol, in a huff. &ldquo;Pierre
      has arrived!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes rose abruptly. A rush of blood rose to her face, her
      eyes brightened, and her lips opened with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;But where is he? How did you hear of his return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! faith, it was just by chance. I was shooting yesterday at
      Fontainebleau, and I returned this morning by the express. On arriving at
      Paris, I alighted on the platform, and there I found myself face to face
      with a tall young man with a long beard, who, seeing me pass, called out,
      &lsquo;Ah, Cayrol!&rsquo; It was Pierre. I only recognized him by his voice. He is
      much changed; with his beard, and his complexion bronzed like an African.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. He pressed my hand. He looked at me for a moment with glistening
      eyes. There was something on his lips which he longed to ask, yet did not;
      but I guessed it. I was afraid of giving way to tenderness, that might
      have ended in my saying something foolish, so I left him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long ago is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About an hour ago. I only just ran home before coming on here. There I
      found Panine waiting for me. He insisted upon accompanying me. I hope you
      won&rsquo;t blame him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not see him just now,&rdquo; she said, looking at Cayrol with a resolute
      air. &ldquo;Where did you leave him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the garden, where I found the young ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As if to verify the banker&rsquo;s words, a merry peal of laughter was heard
      through the half-open window. It was Micheline, who, with returning
      gayety, was making up for the three weeks&rsquo; sadness she had experienced
      during Panine&rsquo;s absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes went to the window, and looked into the garden. Seated
      on the lawn, in large bamboo chairs, the young girls were listening to a
      story the Prince was telling. The morning was bright and mild; the sun
      shining through Micheline&rsquo;s silk sunshade lit up her fair head. Before
      her, Serge, bending his tall figure, was speaking with animation.
      Micheline&rsquo;s eyes were softly fixed on him. Reclining in her armchair, she
      allowed herself to be carried away with his conversation, and thoroughly
      enjoyed his society, of which she had been deprived for the last three
      weeks. Beside her, Jeanne, silently watching the Prince, was mechanically
      nibbling, with her white teeth, a bunch of carnations which she held in
      her hands. A painful thought contracted Mademoiselle de Cernay&rsquo;s brow, and
      her pale lips on the red flowers seemed to be drinking blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mistress slowly turned away from this scene. A shadow had crossed her
      brow, which had, for a moment, become serene again at the announcement of
      Pierre&rsquo;s arrival. She remained silent for a little while, as if
      considering; then coming to a resolution, and turning to Cayrol, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Pierre staying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the Hotel du Louvre,&rdquo; replied the banker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes rang the bell violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My bonnet, my cloak, and the carriage,&rdquo; she said, and with a friendly nod
      to the two men, she went out quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Micheline was still laughing in the garden. Marechal and Cayrol looked at
      each other. Cayrol was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mistress told you all about the matter then? How is it you never
      spoke to me about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should I have been worthy of Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s confidence had I spoken
      of what she wished to keep secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Especially to you. The attitude which you have taken forbade my speaking.
      You favor Prince Panine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you; you are on Pierre Delarue&rsquo;s side?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take no side. I am only a subordinate, you know; I do not count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not attempt to deceive me. Your influence over the mistress is great.
      The confidence she has in you is a conclusive proof. Important events are
      about to take place here. Pierre has certainly returned to claim his right
      as betrothed, and Mademoiselle Micheline loves Prince Serge. Out of this a
      serious conflict will take place in the house. There will be a battle. And
      as the parties in question are about equal in strength, I am seeking
      adherents for my candidate. I own, in all humility, I am on love&rsquo;s side.
      The Prince is beloved by Mademoiselle Desvarennes, and I serve him.
      Micheline will be grateful, and will do me a turn with Mademoiselle de
      Cernay. As to you, let me give you a little advice. If Madame Desvarennes
      consults you, speak well of Panine. When the Prince is master here, your
      position will be all the better for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marechal had listened to Cayrol without anything betraying the impression
      his words created. He looked at the banker in a peculiar manner, which
      caused him to feel uncomfortable, and made him lower his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you do not know, Monsieur Cayrol,&rdquo; said the secretary, after a
      moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;how I entered this firm. It is as well in that case to
      inform you. Four years ago, I was most wretched. After having sought
      fortune ten times without success, I felt myself giving way morally and
      physically. There are some beings gifted with energy, who can surmount all
      the difficulties of life. You are one of those. As for me, the struggle
      exhausted my strength, and I came to grief. It would take too long to
      enumerate all the ways of earning my living I tried. Few even fed me; and
      I was thinking of putting an end to my miserable existence when I met
      Pierre. We had been at college together. I went toward him; he was on the
      quay. I dared to stop him. At first he did not recognize me, I was so
      haggard, so wretched-looking! But when I spoke, he cried, &lsquo;Marechal!&rsquo; and,
      without blushing at my tatters, put his arms round my neck. We were
      opposite the Belle Jardiniere, the clothiers; he wanted to rig me out. I
      remember as if it were but yesterday I said, &lsquo;No, nothing, only find me
      work!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Work, my poor fellow,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;but just look at
      yourself; who would have confidence to give you any? You look like a
      tramp, and when you accosted me a little while ago, I asked myself if you
      were not about to steal my watch!&rsquo; And he laughed gayly, happy at having
      found me again, and thinking that he might be of use to me. Seeing that I
      would not go into the shop, he took off his overcoat, and put it on my
      back to cover my tattered clothes, and there and then he took me to Madame
      Desvarennes. Two days later I entered the office. You see the position I
      hold, and I owe it to Pierre. He has been more than a friend to me&mdash;a
      brother. Come! after that, tell me what you would think of me if I did
      what you have just asked me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol was confused; he twisted his bristly beard with his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, I do not say that your scruples are not right; but, between
      ourselves, every step that is taken against the Prince will count for
      naught. He will marry Mademoiselle Desvarennes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is possible. In that case, I shall be here to console Pierre and
      sympathize with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in the mean time you are going to do all you can in his favor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already had the honor of telling you that I cannot do anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well. One knows what talking means, and you will not change my idea
      of your importance. You take the weaker side then; that&rsquo;s superb!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is but strictly honest,&rdquo; said Marechal. &ldquo;It is true that that quality
      has become very rare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol wheeled round on his heels. He took a few steps toward the door,
      then, returning to Marechal, held out his hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a grudge, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The secretary allowed his hand to be shaken without answering, and the
      banker went out, saying to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is without a sou and has prejudices! There&rsquo;s a lad without a future.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. THE RIVALS
    </h2>
    <p>
      On reaching Paris, Pierre Delarue experienced a strange feeling. In his
      feverish haste he longed for the swiftness of electricity to bring him
      near Micheline. As soon as he arrived in Paris, he regretted having
      travelled so fast. He longed to meet his betrothed, yet feared to know his
      fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a sort of presentiment that his reception would destroy his hopes.
      And the more he tried to banish these thoughts, the more forcibly they
      returned. The thought that Micheline had forgotten her promise made the
      blood rush to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s short letter suggested it. That his betrothed was
      lost to him he understood, but he would not admit it. How was it possible
      that Micheline should forget him? All his childhood passed before his
      mind. He remembered the sweet and artless evidences of affection which the
      young girl had given him. And yet she no longer loved him! It was her own
      mother who said so. After that could he still hope?
    </p>
    <p>
      A prey to this deep trouble, Pierre entered Paris. On finding himself face
      to face with Cayrol, the young man&rsquo;s first idea was, as Cayrol had
      guessed, to cry out, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Is all lost to me?&rdquo; A sort of
      anxious modesty kept back the words on his lips. He would not admit that
      he doubted. And, then, Cayrol would only have needed to answer that all
      was over, and that he could put on mourning for his love. He turned
      around, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tumult of Paris surprised and stunned him. After spending a year in
      the peaceful solitudes of Africa, to find himself amid the cries of
      street-sellers, the rolling of carriages, and the incessant movement of
      the great city, was too great a contrast to him. Pierre was overcome by
      languor; his head seemed too heavy for his body to carry; he mechanically
      entered a cab which conveyed him to the Hotel du Louvre. Through the
      window, against the glass of which he tried to cool his heated forehead,
      he saw pass in procession before his eyes, the Column of July, the church
      of St. Paul, the Hotel de Ville in ruins, and the colonnade of the Louvre.
    </p>
    <p>
      An absurd idea took possession of him. He remembered that during the
      Commune he was nearly killed in the Rue Saint-Antoine by the explosion of
      a shell, thrown by the insurgents from the heights of Pere-Lachaise. He
      thought that had he died then, Micheline would have wept for him. Then, as
      in a nightmare, it seemed to him that this hypothesis was realized. He saw
      the church hung with black, he heard the funeral chants. A catafalque
      contained his coffin, and slowly his betrothed came, with a trembling
      hand, to throw holy water on the cloth which covered the bier. And a voice
      said within him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are dead, since Micheline is about to marry another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made an effort to banish this importunate idea. He could not succeed.
      Thoughts flew through his brain with fearful rapidity. He thought he was
      beginning to be seized with brain fever. And this dismal ceremony kept
      coming before him with the same chants, the same words repeated, and the
      same faces appearing. The houses seemed to fly before his vacant eyes. To
      stop this nightmare he tried to count the gas-lamps: one, two, three,
      four, five&mdash;but the same thought interrupted his calculation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are dead, since your betrothed is about to marry another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was afraid he was going mad. A sharp pain shot across his forehead just
      above the right eyebrow. In the old days he had felt the same pain when he
      had overworked himself in preparing for his examinations at the
      Polytechnic School. With a bitter smile he asked himself if one of the
      aching vessels in his brain was about to burst?
    </p>
    <p>
      The sudden stoppage of the cab freed him from this torture. The hotel
      porter opened the door. Pierre stepped out mechanically. Without speaking
      a word he followed a waiter, who showed him to a room on the second floor.
      Left alone, he sat down. This room, with its commonplace furniture,
      chilled him. He saw in it a type of his future life: lonely and desolate.
      Formerly, when he used to come to Paris, he stayed with Madame
      Desvarennes, where he had the comforts of home, and every one looked on
      him affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, at the hotel, orders were obeyed with politeness at so much a day.
      Would it always be thus in future?
    </p>
    <p>
      This painful impression dissipated his weakness as by enchantment. He so
      bitterly regretted the sweets of the past, that he resolved to struggle to
      secure them for the future. He dressed himself quickly, and removed all
      the traces of his journey; then, his mind made up, he jumped into a cab,
      and drove to Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s. All indecision had left him. His fears
      now seemed contemptible. He must defend himself. It was a question of his
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Place de la Concorde a carriage passed his cab. He recognized the
      livery of Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s coachman and leant forward. The mistress
      did not see him. He was about to stop the cab and tell his driver to
      follow her carriage when a sudden thought decided him to go on. It was
      Micheline he wanted to see. His future destiny depended on her. Madame
      Desvarennes had made him clearly understand that by calling for his help
      in her fatal letter. He went on his way, and in a few minutes arrived at
      the mansion in the Rue Saint-Dominique.
    </p>
    <p>
      Micheline and Jeanne were still in the garden, seated in the same place on
      the lawn. Cayrol had joined Serge. Both, profiting by the lovely morning,
      were enjoying the society of their beloved ones. A quick step on the
      gravel walk attracted their attention. In the sunlight a young man, whom
      neither Jeanne nor Micheline recognized, was advancing. When about two
      yards distant from the group he slowly raised his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the constrained and astonished manner of the young girls, a sad
      smile played on his lips, then he said, softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I then so changed that I must tell you my name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words Micheline jumped up, she became as white as her collar, and
      trembling, with sobs rising to her lips, stood silent and petrified before
      Pierre. She could not speak, but her eyes were eagerly fixed on the young
      man. It was he, the companion of her youth, so changed that she had not
      recognized him; worn by hard work, perhaps by anxieties, bronzed&mdash;and
      with his face hidden by a black beard which gave him a manly and energetic
      appearance. It was certainly he, with a thin red ribbon at his
      button-hole, which he had not when he went away, and which showed the
      importance of the works he had executed and of great perils he had faced.
      Pierre, trembling and motionless, was silent; the sound of his voice
      choked with emotion had frightened him. He had expected a cold reception,
      but this scared look, which resembled terror, was beyond all he had
      pictured. Serge wondered and watched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne broke the icy silence. She went up to Pierre, and presented her
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you kiss your friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled affectionately on him. Two grateful tears sparkled in the young
      man&rsquo;s eyes, and fell on Mademoiselle de Cernay&rsquo;s hair. Micheline, led away
      by the example and without quite knowing what she was doing, found herself
      in Pierre&rsquo;s arms. The situation was becoming singularly perplexing to
      Serge. Cayrol, who had not lost his presence of mind, understood it, and
      turning toward the Prince, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Pierre Delarue: an old friend and companion of Mademoiselle
      Desvarennes&rsquo;s; almost a brother to her,&rdquo; thus explaining in one word all
      that could appear unusual in such a scene of tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, addressing Pierre, he simply added&mdash;&ldquo;Prince Panine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men looked at each other. Serge, with haughty curiosity; Pierre,
      with inexpressible rage. In a moment, he guessed that the tall, handsome
      man beside his betrothed was his rival. If looks could kill, the Prince
      would have fallen down dead. Panine did not deign to notice the hatred
      which glistened in the eyes of the newcomer. He turned toward Micheline
      with exquisite grace and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother receives her friends this evening, I think, Mademoiselle; I
      shall have the honor of paying my respects to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And taking leave of Jeanne with a smile, and of Pierre with a courteous
      bow, he left, accompanied by Cayrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge&rsquo;s departure was a relief to Micheline. Between these two men to whom
      she belonged, to the one by a promise, to the other by an avowal, she felt
      ashamed. Left alone with Pierre she recovered her self-possession, and
      felt full of pity for the poor fellow threatened with such cruel
      deception. She went tenderly to him, with her loving eyes of old, and
      pressed his hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad to see you again, my dear Pierre; and my mother will be
      delighted. We were very anxious about you. You have not written to us for
      some months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre tried to joke: &ldquo;The post does not leave very often in the desert. I
      wrote whenever I had an opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it so very pleasant in Africa that you could not tear yourself away a
      whole year?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to take another journey on the coast of Tripoli to finish my
      labors. I was interested in my work, and anxious not to lose the result of
      so much effort, and I think I have succeeded&mdash;at least in&mdash;the
      opinion of my employers,&rdquo; said the young man, with a ghastly smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Pierre, you come in time from the land of the sphinx,&rdquo;
       interrupted Jeanne gravely, and glancing intently at Micheline. &ldquo;There is
      here, I assure you, a difficult enigma to solve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That which is written in this heart,&rdquo; she replied, lightly touching her
      companion&rsquo;s breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From childhood I have always read it as easily as a book,&rdquo; said Pierre,
      with tremulous voice, turning toward the amazed Micheline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Cernay tossed her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows? Perhaps her disposition has changed during your absence;&rdquo; and
      nodding pleasantly, she went toward the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre followed her for a moment with his eyes, then, turning toward his
      betrothed, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Micheline, shall I tell you your secret? You no longer love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl started. The attack was direct. She must at once give an
      explanation. She had often thought of what she would say when Pierre came
      back to her. The day had arrived unexpectedly. And the answers she had
      prepared had fled. The truth appeared harsh and cold. She understood that
      the change in her was treachery, of which Pierre was the innocent victim;
      and feeling herself to blame, she waited tremblingly the explosion of this
      loyal heart so cruelly wounded. She stammered, in tremulous accents:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pierre, my friend, my brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother!&rdquo; cried the young man, bitterly. &ldquo;Was that the name you were
      to give me on my return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words, which so completely summed up the situation, Micheline
      remained silent. Still she felt that at all hazards she must defend
      herself. Her mother might come in at any moment. Between Madame
      Desvarennes and her betrothed, what would become of her? The hour was
      decisive. Her strong love for Serge gave her fresh energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you go away?&rdquo; she asked, with sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre raised with pride his head which had been bent with anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be worthy of you,&rdquo; he merely said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not need to be worthy of me; you, who were already above every
      one else. We were betrothed; you only had to guard me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could not your heart guard itself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without help, without the support of your presence and affection?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without other help or support than I had myself: Hope and Remembrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Micheline turned pale. Each word spoken by Pierre made her feel the
      unworthiness of her conduct more completely. She endeavored to find a new
      excuse:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pierre, you know I was only a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the young man, with choked voice, &ldquo;I see that you were already
      a woman; a being weak, inconstant, and cruel; who cares not for the love
      she inspires, and sacrifices all to the love she feels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So long as Pierre had only complained, Micheline felt overwhelmed and
      without strength; but the young man began to accuse. In a moment the young
      girl regained her presence of mind and revolted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those are hard words!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they not deserved?&rdquo; cried Pierre, no longer restraining himself. &ldquo;You
      saw me arrive trembling, with eyes full of tears, and not only had you not
      an affectionate word to greet me with, but you almost accuse me of
      indifference. You reproach me with having gone away. Did you not know my
      motive for going? I was betrothed to you; you were rich and I was poor. To
      remove this inequality I resolved to make a name. I sought one of those
      perilous scientific missions which bring celebrity or death to those who
      undertake them. Ah! think not that I went away from you without
      heart-breaking! For a year I was almost alone, crushed with fatigue,
      always in danger; the thought that I was suffering for you supported me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When lost in the vast desert, I was sad and discouraged; I invoked you,
      and your sweet face gave me fresh hope and energy. I said to myself, &lsquo;She
      is waiting for me. A day will come when I shall win the prize of all my
      trouble.&rsquo; Well, Micheline, the day has come; here I am, returned, and I
      ask for my reward. Is it what I had a right to expect? While I was running
      after glory, another, more practical and better advised, stole your heart.
      My happiness is destroyed. You did well to forget me. The fool who goes so
      far away from his betrothed does not deserve her faithfulness. He is cold,
      indifferent, he does not know how to love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These vehement utterances troubled Micheline deeply. For the first time
      she understood her betrothed, felt how much he loved her, and regretted
      not having known it before. If Pierre had spoken like that before going
      away, who knows? Micheline&rsquo;s feelings might have been quickened. No doubt
      she would have loved him. It would have come naturally. But Pierre had
      kept the secret of his passion for the young girl to himself. It was only
      despair, and the thought of losing her, that made him give vent to his
      feelings now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that I have been cruel and unjust to you,&rdquo; said Micheline. &ldquo;I
      deserve your reproaches, but I am not the only one to blame. You, too, are
      at fault. What I have just heard has upset me. I am truly sorry to cause
      you so much pain; but it is too late. I no longer belong to myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you belong to yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! It is true, you had my word, but be generous. Do not abuse the
      authority which being my betrothed gives you. That promise I would now ask
      back from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I refuse to release you from your promise? If I tried to, regain
      your love?&rdquo; cried Pierre, forcibly. &ldquo;Have I not the right to defend
      myself? And what would you think of my love if I relinquished you so
      readily?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. The interview was at its highest pitch of
      excitement. Micheline knew that she must put an end to it. She replied
      with firmness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A girl such as I am will not break her word; mine belongs to you, but my
      heart is another&rsquo;s. Say you insist, and I am ready to keep my promise to
      become your wife. It is for you to decide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre gave the young girl a look which plunged into the depths of her
      heart. He read there her resolve that she would act loyally, but that at
      the same time she would never forget him who had so irresistibly gained
      her heart. He made a last effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said, with ardent voice, &ldquo;it is impossible that you can have
      forgotten me so soon: I love you so much! Remember our affection in the
      old days, Micheline. Remember!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He no longer argued; he pleaded. Micheline felt victorious. She was moved
      with pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! my poor Pierre, my affection was only friendship, and my heart has
      not changed toward you. The love which I now feel is quite different. If
      it had not come to me, I might have been your wife. And I esteemed you so
      much, that I should have been happy. But now I understand the difference.
      You, whom I had accepted, would never have been more to me than a tender
      companion; he whom I have chosen will be my master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre uttered a cry at this cruel and frank avowal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! how you hurt me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And bitter tears rolled down his face to the relief of his overburdened
      heart. He sank on to a seat, and for a moment gave way to violent grief.
      Micheline, more touched by his despair than she had been by his
      reproaches, went to him and wiped his face with her lace handkerchief. Her
      white hand was close to the young man&rsquo;s mouth,&mdash;and he kissed it
      eagerly. Then, as if roused by the action, he rose with a changed look in
      his eyes, and seized the young girl in his arms. Micheline did not utter a
      word. She looked coldly and resolutely at Pierre, and threw back her head
      to avoid the contact of his eager lips. That look was enough. The arms
      which held her were unloosed, and Pierre moved away, murmuring:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon. You see I am not in my right mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then passing his hand across his forehead as if to chase away a wicked
      thought, he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is irrevocable? You love him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough to give you so much pain; enough to be nobody&rsquo;s unless I belong to
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre reflected a moment, then, coming to a decision:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, you are free,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I give you back your promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Micheline uttered a cry of triumph, which made him who had been her
      betrothed turn pale. She regretted not having hidden her joy better. She
      approached Pierre and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me that you forgive me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You still weep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I am weeping over my lost happiness. I thought the best means of
      being loved were to deserve it. I was mistaken. I will courageously atone
      for my error. Excuse my weakness, and believe that you will never have a
      more faithful and devoted friend than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Micheline gave him her hand, and, smiling, bowed her forehead to his lips.
      He slowly impressed a brotherly kiss, which effaced the burning trace of
      the one which he had stolen a moment before.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time a deep voice was heard in the distance, calling Pierre.
      Micheline trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis my mother,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She is seeking you. I will leave you. Adieu,
      and a thousand thanks from my very heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And nimbly springing behind a clump of lilac-trees in flower, Micheline
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre mechanically went toward the house. He ascended the marble steps
      and entered the drawing-room. As he shut the door, Madame Desvarennes
      appeared.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. A CRITICAL INTERVIEW
    </h2>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes had been driven to the Hotel du Louvre without losing a
      minute. She most wanted to know in what state of mind her daughter&rsquo;s
      betrothed had arrived in Paris. Had the letter, which brutally told him
      the truth, roused him and tightened the springs of his will? Was he ready
      for the struggle?
    </p>
    <p>
      If she found him confident and bold, she had only to settle with him as to
      the common plan of action which must bring about the eviction of the
      audacious candidate who wished to marry Micheline. If she found him
      discouraged and doubtful of himself, she had decided to animate him with
      her ardor against Serge Panine.
    </p>
    <p>
      She prepared these arguments on the way, and, boiling with impatience,
      outstripped in thought the fleet horse which was drawing her past the long
      railings of the Tuileries toward the Hotel du Louvre. Wrapped in her
      meditations she did not see Pierre. She was saying to herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This fair-haired Polish dandy does not know with whom he has to deal. He
      will see what sort of a woman I am. He has not risen early enough in the
      morning to hoodwink me. If Pierre is only of the same opinion as I, we
      shall soon spoil this fortune-hunter&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carriage stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Pierre Delarue?&rdquo; inquired the mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, he went out a quarter of an hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To go where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know whether he will be absent long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much obliged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes, quite discomfited by this mischance, reflected. Where
      could Pierre have gone? Probably to her house. Without losing a minute,
      she reentered the carriage, and gave orders to return to the Rue
      Saint-Dominique. If he had gone at once to her house, it was plain that he
      was ready to do anything to keep Micheline. The coachman who had received
      the order drove furiously. She said to herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pierre is in a cab. Allowing that he is driving moderately quick he will
      only have half-an-hour&rsquo;s start of me. He will pass through the office,
      will see Marechal, and however eager he be, will lose a quarter of an hour
      in chatting to him. It would be most vexing if he did anything foolish in
      the remaining fifteen minutes! The fault is mine: I ought to have sent him
      a letter at Marseilles, to tell him what line of conduct to adopt on his
      arrival. So long as he does not meet Micheline on entering the house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that idea Madame Desvarennes felt the blood rushing to her face. She
      put her head out of the carriage window, and called to the coachman:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive faster!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drove more furiously still, and in a few minutes reached the Rue
      Saint-Dominique.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tore into the house like a hurricane, questioned the hall-porter, and
      learned that Delarue had arrived. She hastened to Marechal, and asked him
      in such a strange manner, &ldquo;Have you seen Pierre?&rdquo; that he thought some
      accident had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      On seeing her secretary&rsquo;s scared look, she understood that what she most
      dreaded had come to pass. She hurried to the drawing-room, calling Pierre
      in a loud voice. The French window opened, and she found herself face to
      face with the young man. A glance at her adopted son&rsquo;s face increased her
      fears. She opened her arms and clasped Pierre to her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first emotions were over, she longed to know what had happened
      during her absence, and inquired of Pierre:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By whom were you received on arriving here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Micheline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I feared! What did she tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In three sentences these two strong beings had summed up all that had
      taken place. Madame Desvarennes remained silent for a moment, then, with
      sudden tenderness, and as if to make up for her daughter&rsquo;s treachery,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, let me kiss you again, my poor boy. You suffer, eh? and I too! I am
      quite overcome. For ten years I have cherished the idea of your marrying
      Micheline. You are a man of merit, and you have no relatives. You would
      not take my daughter away from me; on the contrary I think you like me,
      and would willingly live with me. In arranging this marriage I realized
      the dream of my life. I was not taking a son-in-law-I was gaining a new
      child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me,&rdquo; said Pierre, sadly, &ldquo;it is not my fault that your wish is
      not carried out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, my boy, is another question!&rdquo; cried Madame Desvarennes, whose voice
      was at once raised two tones. &ldquo;And that is where we do not agree. You are
      responsible for what has occurred. I know what you are going, to tell me.
      You wished to bring laurels to Micheline as a dower. That is all nonsense!
      When one leaves the Polytechnic School with honors, and with a future open
      to you like yours, it is not necessary to scour the deserts to dazzle a
      young girl. One begins by marrying her, and celebrity comes afterward, at
      the same time as the children. And then there was no need to risk all at
      such a cost. What, are we then so grand? Ex-bakers! Millionaires,
      certainly, which does not alter the fact that poor Desvarennes carried out
      the bread, and that I gave change across the counter when folks came to
      buy sou-cakes! But you wanted to be a knight-errant, and, during that
      time, a handsome fellow. Did Micheline tell you the gentleman&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met him when I came here; he was with her in the garden. We were
      introduced to each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was good taste,&rdquo; said Madame Desvarennes with irony. &ldquo;Oh, he is a
      youth who is not easily disturbed, and in his most passionate transports
      will not disarrange a fold of his cravat. You know he is a Prince? That is
      most flattering to the Desvarennes! We shall use his coat-of-arms as our
      trade-mark. The fortune hunter, ugh! No doubt he said to himself, &lsquo;The
      baker has money&mdash;and her daughter is agreeable.&rsquo; And he is making a
      business of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is only following the example of many of his equals. Marriage is
      to-day the sole pursuit of the nobility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nobility! That of our country might be tolerated, but foreign
      noblemen are mere adventurers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well known that the Panines come from Posen&mdash;the papers have
      mentioned them more than twenty times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is he not in his own country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is exiled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has done something wrong, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has, like all his family, fought for independence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he is a revolutionist!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A patriot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind to tell me all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may hate Prince Panine,&rdquo; said Pierre, simply, &ldquo;but that is no reason
      why I should not be just to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it; he is an exceptional being, a great citizen, a hero, if you
      like. But that does not prove that he will make my daughter happy. And if
      you take my advice, we shall send him about his business in a very short
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes was excited and paced hurriedly up and down the room.
      The idea of resuming the offensive after she had been forced to act on the
      defensive for months past pleased her. She thought Pierre argued too much.
      A woman of action, she did not understand why Pierre had not yet come to a
      resolution. She felt that she must gain his confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are master of the situation,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The Prince does not suit me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Micheline loves him,&rdquo; interrupted Pierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She fancies so,&rdquo; replied Madame Desvarennes. &ldquo;She has got it into her
      head, but it will wear off. You thoroughly understand that I did not bid
      you to come from Africa to be present at my daughter&rsquo;s wedding. If you are
      a man, we shall see some fun. Micheline is your betrothed. You have our
      word, and the word of a Desvarennes is as good as the signature.&mdash;It
      has never been dishonored. Well, refuse to give us back our promise. Gain
      time, make love, and take my daughter away from that dandy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre remained silent for a few minutes. In a moment he measured the
      extent of the mischief done, by seeing Micheline before consulting Madame
      Desvarennes. With the help of this energetic woman he might have
      struggled, whereas left to his own strength, he had at the outset been
      vanquished and forced to lay down his arms. Not only had he yielded, but
      he had drawn his ally into his defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your encouragements come too late,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Micheline asked me to give
      her back her promise, and I gave it to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were so weak as that!&rdquo; cried Madame Desvarennes. &ldquo;And she had so much
      boldness? Does she dote on him so? I suspected her plans, and I hastened
      to warn you. But all is not lost. You have given Micheline back her
      promise. So be it. But I have not given you back yours. You are pledged to
      me. I will not countenance the marriage which my daughter has arranged
      without my consent! Help me to break it off. And, faith, you could easily
      find another woman worth Micheline, but where shall I find a son-in-law
      worth you? Come, the happiness of us all is in peril; save it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why continue the struggle? I am beaten beforehand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you forsake me, what can I do single-handed with Micheline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what she wishes, as usual. You are surprised at my giving you this
      advice? It is no merit on my part. Until now you have refused your
      daughter&rsquo;s request; but if she comes again beseeching and crying, you who
      are so strong and can say so well &lsquo;I will,&rsquo; will be weak and will not be
      able to refuse her her Prince. Believe me; consent willingly. Who knows?
      Your son&rsquo;-in-law may be grateful to you for it by-and-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes had listened to Pierre with amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, you are incredible,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you discuss all this so calmly.
      Have you no grief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Pierre, solemnly, &ldquo;it is almost killing me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! You are boasting!&rdquo; cried Madame Desvarennes, vehemently. &ldquo;Ah,
      scholar! figures have dried up your heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the young man, with melancholy, &ldquo;but work has destroyed in
      me the seductions of youth. It has made me thoughtful, and a little sad. I
      frightened Micheline, instead of attracting her. The worst is that we live
      in such a state of high pressure, it is quite impossible to grasp all that
      is offered to us in this life-work and pleasure. It is necessary to make a
      choice, to economize one&rsquo;s time and strength, and to work with either the
      heart or the brain alone. The result is that the neglected organ wastes
      away, and that men of pleasure remain all their lives mediocre workers,
      while hard workers are pitiful lovers. The former sacrifice the dignity of
      existence, the latter that which is the charm of existence. So that, in
      decisive moments, when the man of pleasure appeals to his intelligence, he
      finds he is unfit for duty, and when the man of toil appeals to his heart,
      he finds that he is unqualified for happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my boy, so much the worse for the women who cannot appreciate men
      of work, and who allow themselves to be wheedled by men of pleasure. I
      never was one of those; and serious as you are, thirty years ago I would
      have jumped at you. But as you know your ailment so well, why don&rsquo;t you
      cure yourself? The remedy is at hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strong will. Marry Micheline. I&rsquo;ll answer for everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does not love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman always ends by loving her husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love Micheline too much to accept her hand without her heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes saw that she would gain nothing, and that the game was
      irrevocably lost. A great sorrow stole over her. She foresaw a dark
      future, and had a presentiment that trouble had entered the house with
      Serge Panine. What could she do? Combat the infatuation of her daughter!
      She knew that life would be odious for her if Micheline ceased to laugh
      and to sing. Her daughter&rsquo;s tears would conquer her will. Pierre had told
      her truly. Where was the use of fighting when defeat was certain? She,
      too, felt that she was powerless, and with heartfelt sorrow came to a
      decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, I see that I must make up my mind to be grandmother to little
      princes. It pleases me but little on the father&rsquo;s account. My daughter
      will have a sad lot with a fellow of that kind. Well, he had better keep
      in the right path; for I shall be there to call him to order. Micheline
      must be happy. When my husband was alive, I was already more of a mother
      than a wife; now my whole life is wrapped up in my daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then raising her vigorous arms with grim energy, she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, if my daughter were made miserable through her husband, I
      should be capable of killing him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These were the last words of the interview which decided the destiny of
      Micheline, of the Prince, of Madame Desvarennes, and of Pierre. The
      mistress stretched out her hand and rang the bell. A servant appeared, to
      whom she gave instructions to tell Marechal to come down. She thought it
      would be pleasant for Pierre to pour out his griefs into the heart of his
      friend. A man weeps with difficulty before a woman, and she guessed that
      the young man&rsquo;s heart was swollen with tears. Marechal was not far off. He
      arrived in a moment, and springing toward Pierre put his arms round his
      neck. When Madame Desvarennes saw the two friends fully engrossed with
      each other, she said to Marechal:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you leave until this evening. Then bring Pierre back with you; I
      wish to see him after dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with a firm step she went toward Micheline&rsquo;s room, where the latter
      was waiting in fear to know the result of the interview.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. A SIGNIFICANT MEETING
    </h2>
    <p>
      The mansion in the Rue Saint-Dominique is certainly one of the finest to
      be seen. Sovereigns alone have more sumptuous palaces. The wide staircase,
      of carved oak, is bordered by a bronze balustrade, made by Ghirlandajo,
      and brought from Florence by Sommervieux, the great dealer in curiosities.
      Baron Rothschild would consent to give only a hundred thousand francs for
      it. Madame Desvarennes bought it. The large panels of the staircase are
      hung with splendid tapestry, from designs by Boucher, representing the
      different metamorphoses of Jupiter. At each landing-place stands a massive
      Japanese vase of &lsquo;claisonne&rsquo; enamel, supported by a tripod of Chinese
      bronze, representing chimeras. On the first floor, tall columns of red
      granite, crowned by gilt capitals, divide the staircase from a gallery,
      serving as a conservatory. Plaited blinds of crimson silk hang before the
      Gothic windows, filled with marvellous stained glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the vestibule-the hangings of which are of Cordova-leather, with gold
      ground-seemingly awaiting the good pleasure of some grand lady, is a
      sedan-chair, decorated with paintings by Fragonard. Farther on, there is
      one of those superb carved mother-of-pearl coffers, in which Oriental
      women lay by their finery and jewellery. A splendid Venetian mirror, its
      frame embellished with tiny figure subjects, and measuring two metres in
      width and three in height, fills a whole panel of the vestibule. Portieres
      of Chinese satin, ornamented with striking embroidery, such as figures on
      a priest&rsquo;s chasuble, fall in sumptuous folds at the drawing-room and
      dining-room doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drawing-room contains a splendid set of Louis Quatorze furniture, of
      gilt wood, upholstered in fine tapestry, in an extraordinary state of
      preservation. Three crystal lustres, hanging at intervals along the room,
      sparkle like diamonds. The hangings, of woven silk and gold, are those
      which were sent as a present by Louis Quatorze to Monsieur de Pimentel,
      the Spanish Ambassador, to reward him for the part he had taken in the
      conclusion of the Treaty of the Pyrenees. These hangings are unique, and
      were brought back from Spain in 1814, in the baggage-train of Soult&rsquo;s
      army, and sold to an inhabitant of Toulouse for ten thousand francs. It
      was there that Madame Desvarennes discovered them in a garret in 1864,
      neglected by the grandchildren of the buyer, who were ignorant of the
      immense value of such unrivalled work. Cleverly mended, they are to-day
      the pride of the great trader&rsquo;s drawing-room. On the mantelpiece there is
      a large clock in Chinese lacquer, ornamented with gilt bronze, made on a
      model sent out from Paris in the reign of Louis Quatorze, and representing
      the Flight of the Hours pursued by Time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adjoining the great drawing-room is a boudoir upholstered in light gray
      silk damask, with bouquets of flowers. This is Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s
      favorite room. A splendid Erard piano occupies one side of the apartment.
      Facing it is a sideboard in sculptured ebony, enriched with bronze, by
      Gouthieres. There are only two pictures on the walls: &ldquo;The Departure of
      the Newly Married Couple,&rdquo; exquisitely painted by Lancret; and &ldquo;The
      Prediction,&rdquo; an adorable work by Watteau, bought at an incredible price at
      the Pourtales sale. Over the chimney-piece is a miniature by Pommayrac,
      representing Micheline as a little child&mdash;a treasure which Madame
      Desvarennes cannot behold without tears coming to her eyes. A door, hidden
      by curtains, opens on to a staircase leading directly to the courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dining-room is in the purest Renaissance style austere woodwork;
      immense chests of caned pearwood, on which stand precious ewers in Urbino
      ware, and dishes by Bernard Palissy. The high stone fireplace is
      surmounted by a portrait of Diana of Poitiers, with a crescent on her
      brow, and is furnished with firedogs of elaborately worked iron. The
      centre panel bears the arms of Admiral Bonnivet. Stained-glass windows
      admit a softly-tinted light. From the magnificently painted ceiling, a
      chandelier of brass repousse work hangs from the claws of a hovering
      eagle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The billiard-room is in the Indian style. Magnificent panoplies unite
      Rajpoot shields, Mahratta scimitars, helmets with curtains of steel, rings
      belonging to Afghan chiefs, and long lances ornamented with white mares&rsquo; 
      tails, wielded by the horsemen of Cabul. The walls are painted from
      designs brought from Lahore. The panels of the doors were decorated by
      Gerome. The great artist has painted Nautch girls twisting their floating
      scarves, and jugglers throwing poignards into the air. Around the room are
      low divans, covered with soft and brilliant Oriental cloth. The chandelier
      is quite original in form, being the exact representation of the god
      Vishnu. From the centre of the body hangs a lotus leaf of emeralds, and
      from each of the four arms is suspended a lamp shaped like a Hindu pagoda,
      which throws out a mellow light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes was entertaining her visitors in these celebrated
      apartments that evening. Marechal and Pierre had just come in, and were
      talking together near the fireplace. A few steps from them was a group,
      consisting of Cayrol, Madame Desvarennes, and a third person, who had
      never until then put his foot in the house, in spite of intercessions in
      his favor made by the banker to Madame Desvarennes. He was a tall, pale,
      thin man, whose skin seemed stretched on his bones, with a strongly
      developed under-jaw, like that of a ravenous animal, and eyes of
      indefinable color, always changing, and veiled behind golden-rimmed
      spectacles. His hands were soft and smooth, with moist palms and closely
      cut nails&mdash;vicious hands, made to take cunningly what they coveted.
      He had scanty hair, of a pale yellow, parted just above the ear, so as to
      enable him to brush it over the top of his head. This personage, clad in a
      double-breasted surtout, over a white waistcoat, and wearing a
      many-colored rosette, was called Hermann Herzog.
    </p>
    <p>
      A daring financier, he had come from Luxembourg, preceded by a great
      reputation; and, in a few months, he had launched in Paris such a series
      of important affairs that the big-wigs on the Exchange felt bound to treat
      with him. There were many rumors current about him. Some said he was the
      most intelligent, most active, and most scrupulous of men that it was
      possible to meet. Others said that no greater scoundrel had ever dared the
      vengeance of the law, after plundering honest people. Of German
      nationality, those who cried him down said he was born at Mayence. Those
      who treated the rumors as legends said he was born at Frankfort, the most
      Gallic town beyond the river Rhine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had just completed an important line of railway from Morocco to the
      centre of our colony in Algeria, and now he was promoting a company for
      exporting grain and flour from America. Several times Cayrol had tried to
      bring Herzog and Madame Desvarennes together. The banker had an interest
      in the grain and flour speculation, but he asserted that it would not
      succeed unless the mistress had a hand in it. Cayrol had a blind faith in
      the mistress&rsquo;s luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes, suspicious of everything foreign, and perfectly
      acquainted with the rumors circulated respecting Herzog, had always
      refused to receive him. But Cayrol had been so importunate that, being
      quite tired of refusing, and, besides, being willing to favor Cayrol for
      having so discreetly managed the negotiations of Micheline&rsquo;s marriage, she
      had consented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herzog had just arrived. He was expressing to Madame Desvarennes his
      delight at being admitted to her house. He had so often heard her highly
      spoken of that he had formed a high idea of her, but one which was,
      however, far below the reality; he understood now that it was an honor to
      be acquainted with her. He wheedled her with German grace, and with a
      German-Jewish accent, which reminds one of the itinerant merchants, who
      offer you with persistence &ldquo;a goot pargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mistress had been rather cold at first, but Herzog&rsquo;s amiability had
      thawed her. This man, with his slow speech and queer eyes, produced a
      fascinating effect on one like a serpent. He was repugnant, and yet, in
      spite of one&rsquo;s self one was led on. He, had at once introduced the grain
      question, but in this he found himself face to face with the real Madame
      Desvarennes; and no politeness held good on her part when it was a
      question of business. From his first words, she had found a weak point in
      the plan, and had attacked him with such plainness that the financier,
      seeing his enterprise collapse at the sound of the mistress&rsquo;s voice-like
      the walls of Jericho at the sound of the Jewish trumpets&mdash;had beaten
      a retreat, and had changed the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to float a credit and discount company superior to any in the
      world. He would come back and talk with Madame Desvarennes about it,
      because she ought to participate in the large profits which the matter
      promised. There was no risk. The novelty of the undertaking consisted in
      the concurrence of the largest banking-houses of France and abroad, which
      would hinder all competition, and prevent hostility on the part of the
      great money-handlers. It was very curious, and Madame Desvarennes would
      feel great satisfaction in knowing the mechanism of this company, destined
      to become, from the first, the most important in the world, and yet most
      easy to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes neither said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; nor &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Moved by the soft and
      insinuating talkativeness of Herzog, she felt herself treading on
      dangerous ground. It seemed to her that her foot was sinking, as in those
      dangerous peat-mosses of which the surface is covered with green grass,
      tempting one to run on it. Cayrol was under the charm. He drank in the
      German&rsquo;s words. This clever man, who had never till then been duped, had
      found his master in Herzog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre and Marechal had come nearer, and Madame Desvarennes, profiting by
      this mingling of groups, introduced the men to each other. On hearing the
      name of Pierre Delarue, Herzog looked thoughtful, and asked if the young
      man was the renowned engineer whose works on the coast of Africa had
      caused so much talk in Europe? On Madame Desvarennes replying in the
      affirmative, he showered well-chosen compliments on Pierre. He had had the
      pleasure of meeting Delarue in Algeria, when he had gone over to finish
      the railroad in Morocco.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Pierre had stepped back on learning that the constructor of that
      important line was before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! is it you, sir, who carried out that job?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Faith! you
      treated those poor Moors rather hardly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He remembered the misery of the poor natives employed by Europeans who
      superintended the work. Old men, women, and children were placed at the
      disposal of the contractors by the native authorities, to dig up and
      remove the soil; and these poor wretches, crushed with hard work, and
      driven with the lash by drunken overseers&mdash;who commanded them with a
      pistol in hand&mdash;under a burning sun, inhaled the noxious vapors
      arising from the upturned soil, and died like flies. It was a terrible
      sight, and one that Pierre could not forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Herzog, with his cajoling sweetness, protested against this
      exaggerated picture. Delarue had arrived during the dog-days&mdash;a bad
      time. And then, it was necessary for the work to be carried on without
      delay. Besides, a few Moors, more or less&mdash;what did it matter?
      Negroes, all but monkeys!
    </p>
    <p>
      Marechal, who had listened silently until then, interrupted the
      conversation, to defend the monkeys in the name of Littre. He had framed a
      theory, founded on Darwin, and tending to prove that men who despised
      monkeys despised themselves. Herzog, a little taken aback by this
      unexpected reply, had looked at Marechal slyly, asking himself if it was a
      joke. But, seeing Madame Desvarennes laugh, he recovered his
      self-possession. Business could not be carried on in the East as in
      Europe. And then, had it not always been thus? Had not all the great
      discoverers worked the countries which they discovered? Christopher
      Columbus, Cortez&mdash;had they not taken riches from the Indians, in
      exchange for the civilization which they brought them? He (Herzog) had, in
      making a railway in Morocco, given the natives the means of civilizing
      themselves. It was only fair that it should cost them something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herzog uttered his tirade with all the charm of which he was capable; he
      looked to the right and to the left to notice the effect. He saw nothing
      but constrained faces. It seemed as if they were expecting some one or
      something. Time was passing; ten o&rsquo;clock had just struck. From the little
      boudoir sounds of music were occasionally heard, when Micheline&rsquo;s nervous
      hand struck a louder chord on her piano. She was there, anxiously awaiting
      some one or something. Jeanne de Cernay, stretched in an easy-chair, her
      head leaning on her hand, was dreaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the past three weeks the young girl had changed. Her bright wit no
      longer enlivened Micheline&rsquo;s indolent calmness; her brilliant eyes were
      surrounded by blue rings, which denoted nights passed without sleep. The
      change coincided strangely with Prince Panine&rsquo;s departure for England, and
      the sending of the letter which recalled Pierre to Paris. Had the
      inhabitants of the mansion been less occupied with their own troubles,
      they would no doubt have noticed this sudden change, and have sought to
      know the reason. But the attention of all was concentrated on the events
      which had already troubled them, and which would no doubt be yet more
      serious to the house, until lately so quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitors&rsquo; bell sounded, and caused Micheline to rise. The blood rushed
      to her cheeks. She whispered, &ldquo;It is he!&rdquo; and, hesitating, she remained a
      moment leaning on the piano, listening vaguely to the sounds in the
      drawing-room. The footman&rsquo;s voice announcing the visitor reached the young
      girls:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince Panine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne also rose then, and if Micheline had turned round she would have
      been frightened at the pallor of her companion. But Mademoiselle
      Desvarennes was not thinking of Mademoiselle de Cernay; she had just
      raised the heavy door curtain, and calling to Jeanne, &ldquo;Are you coming?&rdquo;
       passed into the drawing-room:
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed Prince Serge, who was expected by Cayrol with impatience, by
      Madame Desvarennes with silent irritation, by Pierre with deep anguish.
      The handsome prince, calm and smiling, with white cravat and elegantly
      fitting dress-coat which showed off his fine figure, advanced toward
      Madame Desvarennes before whom he bowed. He seemed only to have seen
      Micheline&rsquo;s mother. Not a look for the two young girls or the men who were
      around him. The rest of the universe did not seem to count. He bent as if
      before a queen, with a dash of respectful adoration. He seemed to be
      saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am at your feet; my life depends on you; make a sign and I shall
      be the happiest of men or the most miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Micheline followed him with eyes full of pride; she admired his haughty
      grace and his caressing humility. It was by these contrasts that Serge had
      attracted the young girl&rsquo;s notice. She felt herself face to face with a
      strange nature, different from men around her, and had become interested
      in him. Then he had spoken to her, and his sweet penetrating voice had
      touched her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he had achieved with Micheline he longed to achieve with her mother.
      After placing himself at the feet of the mother of her whom he loved, he
      sought the road to her heart. He took his place beside the mistress and
      spoke. He hoped that Madame Desvarennes would excuse the haste of his
      visit. The obedience which he had shown in going away must be a proof to
      her of his submission to her wishes. He was her most devoted and
      respectful servant. He resigned himself to anything she might exact of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes listened to that sweet voice; she had never heard it so
      full of charm. She understood what influence this sweetness had exercised
      over Micheline; she repented not having watched over her more carefully,
      and cursed the hour that had brought all this evil upon them. She was
      obliged, however, to answer him. The mistress went straight to the point.
      She was not one to beat about the bush when once her mind was made up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come, no doubt, sir, to receive an answer to the request you
      addressed to me before your departure for England!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince turned slightly pale. The words which Madame Desvarennes was
      about to pronounce were of such importance to him that he could not help
      feeling moved. He answered, in a suppressed tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not have dared to speak to you on the subject, Madame, especially
      in public; but since you anticipate my desire, I admit I am waiting with
      deep anxiety for one word from you which will decide my fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He continued bent before Madame Desvarennes like a culprit before his
      judge. The mistress was silent for a moment, as if hesitating before
      answering, and then said, gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That word I hesitated to pronounce, but some one in whom I have great
      confidence has advised me to receive you favorably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He, Madame, whoever he may be, has gained my everlasting gratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show it to him,&rdquo; said Madame Desvarennes; &ldquo;he is the companion of
      Micheline&rsquo;s young days, almost a son to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And turning toward Pierre, she pointed him out to Panine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge took three rapid strides toward Pierre, but quick as he had been
      Micheline was before him. Each of the lovers seized a hand of Pierre, and
      pressed it with tender effusion. Panine, with his Polish impetuosity, was
      making the most ardent protestations to Pierre&mdash;he would be indebted
      to him for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Micheline&rsquo;s late betrothed, with despair in his heart, allowed his hands
      to be pressed and wrung in silence. The voice of her whom he loved brought
      tears to his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How generous and good you are!&rdquo; said the young girl, &ldquo;how nobly you have
      sacrificed yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t thank me,&rdquo; replied Pierre; &ldquo;I have no merit in accomplishing what
      you admire. I am weak, you see, and I could not bear to see you suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a great commotion in the drawing-room. Cayrol was explaining to
      Herzog, who was listening with great attention, what was taking place.
      Serge Panine was to be Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s son-in-law. It was a great
      event.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the German; &ldquo;Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s son-in-law will become
      a financial power. And a Prince, too. What a fine name for a board of
      directors!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two financiers looked at each other for a moment; the same thought had
      struck them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but,&rdquo; replied Cayrol, &ldquo;Madame Desvarennes will never allow Panine to
      take part in business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; said Herzog. &ldquo;We shall see how the marriage settlements are
      drawn up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; cried Cayrol, &ldquo;I would not have it said that I was leading Madame
      Desvarennes&rsquo;s son-in-law into speculations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is speaking of that?&rdquo; replied Herzog, coldly. &ldquo;Am I seeking
      shareholders? I have more money than I want; I refuse millions every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know capitalists run after you,&rdquo; said Cayrol, laughingly; &ldquo;and to
      welcome them you affect the scruples of a pretty woman. But let us go and
      congratulate the Prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Cayrol and Herzog were exchanging those few words which had such a
      considerable influence on the future of Serge Panine&mdash;a scene,
      terrible in its simplicity, was going on without being noticed. Micheline
      had thrown herself with a burst of tenderness into her mother&rsquo;s arms.
      Serge was deeply affected by the young girl&rsquo;s affection for him, when a
      trembling hand touched his arm. He turned round. Jeanne de Cernay was
      before him, pale and wan; her eyes sunken into her head like two black
      nails, and her lips tightened by a violent contraction. The Prince stood
      thunderstruck at the sight of her. He looked around him. Nobody was
      observing him. Pierre was beside Marechal, who was whispering those words
      which only true friends can find in the sad hours of life. Madame
      Desvarennes was holding Micheline in her arms. Serge approached
      Mademoiselle de Cernay. Jeanne still fixed on him the same menacing look.
      He was afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what?&rdquo; asked the young girl, with a troubled voice. &ldquo;What have I to
      fear now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you wish?&rdquo; resumed Panine, with old firmness, and with a gesture
      of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to speak with you immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see that is impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol and Herzog approached. Serge smiled at Jeanne with a sign of the
      head which meant &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The young girl turned away in silence, awaiting
      the fulfilment of the promise made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol took her by the hand with tender familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you saying to the happy man who has gained the object of his
      dreams, Mademoiselle? It is not to him you must speak, but to me, to give
      me hope. The moment is propitious; it is the day for betrothals. You know
      how much I love you; do me the favor of no longer repulsing me as you have
      done hitherto! If you would be kind, how charming it would be to celebrate
      the two weddings on the same day. One church, one ceremony, one splendid
      feast would unite two happy couples. Is there nothing in this picture to
      entice you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not easily enticed, as you know,&rdquo; said Jeanne, in a firm voice,
      trying to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Micheline and Madame Desvarennes had drawn near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Cayrol,&rdquo; said Serge, in a tone of command; &ldquo;I am happy to-day;
      perhaps I may succeed in your behalf as I have done in my own. Let me
      plead your cause with Mademoiselle de Cernay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart. I need an eloquent pleader,&rdquo; sighed the banker,
      shaking his head sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Mademoiselle, will you submit to the trial?&rdquo; asked the Prince,
      turning toward Jeanne. &ldquo;We have always been good friends, and I shall be
      almost a brother to you. This gives me some right over your mind and
      heart, it seems to me. Do you authorize me to exercise it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you like, sir,&rdquo; answered Jeanne, coldly. &ldquo;The attempt is novel. Who
      knows? Perhaps it will succeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May Heaven grant it,&rdquo; said Cayrol. Then, approaching Panine:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! dear Prince, what gratitude I shall owe you! You know,&rdquo; added he in a
      whisper, &ldquo;if you need a few thousand louis for wedding presents&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, go, corrupter!&rdquo; replied Serge, with the same forced gayety; &ldquo;you are
      flashing your money in front of us. You see it is not invincible, as you
      are obliged to have recourse to my feeble talents. But know that I am
      working for glory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And turning toward Madame Desvarennes he added: &ldquo;I only ask a quarter of
      an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t defend yourself too much,&rdquo; said Micheline in her companion&rsquo;s ear,
      and giving her a tender kiss which the latter did not return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; said Micheline to Pierre, offering him her arm; &ldquo;I want to
      belong to you alone while Serge is pleading with Jeanne. I will be your
      sister as formerly. If you only knew how I love you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The large French window which led to the garden had just been opened by
      Marechal, and the mild odors of a lovely spring night perfumed the
      drawing-room. They all went out on the lawn. Thousands of stars were
      twinkling in the sky, and the eyes of Micheline and Pierre were lifted
      toward the dark blue heavens seeking vaguely for the star which presided
      over their destiny. She, to know whether her life would be the long poem
      of love of which she dreamed; he, to ask whether glory, that exacting
      mistress for whom he had made so many sacrifices, would at least comfort
      him for his lost love.

      CHAPTER VII. JEANNE&rsquo;S SECRET
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the drawing-room Jeanne and Serge remained standing, facing each other.
      The mask had fallen from their faces; the forced smile had disappeared.
      They looked at each other attentively, like two duellists seeking to read
      each other&rsquo;s game, so that they may ward off the fatal stroke and prepare
      the decisive parry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you leave for England three weeks ago, without seeing me and
      without speaking to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could I have said to you?&rdquo; replied the Prince, with an air of
      fatigue and dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne flashed a glance brilliant as lightning:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could have told me that you had just asked for Micheline&rsquo;s hand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would have been brutal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been honest! But it would have necessitated an explanation,
      and you don&rsquo;t like explaining. You have preferred leaving me to guess this
      news from the acts of those around me, and the talk of strangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All these words had been spoken by Jeanne with feverish vivacity. The
      sentences were as cutting as strokes from a whip. The young girl&rsquo;s
      agitation was violent; her cheeks were red, and her breathing was hard and
      stifled with emotion. She stopped for a moment; then, turning toward the
      Prince, and looking him full in the face, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, this marriage is decided?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge answered,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was fainter than a whisper. As if she could not believe it, Jeanne
      repeated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to marry Micheline?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as Panine in a firmer voice answered again, &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; the young girl took
      two rapid steps and brought her flushed face close to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, then?&rdquo; she cried with a violence she could no longer restrain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge made a sign. The drawing-room window was still open, and from
      outside they could be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jeanne, in mercy calm yourself,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;You are in a state of
      excitement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which makes you uncomfortable?&rdquo; interrupted the young girl mockingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but for your sake only,&rdquo; said he, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. I fear your committing an imprudence which might harm you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but you with me! And it is that only which makes you afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince looked at Mademoiselle de Cernay, smilingly. Changing his tone,
      he took her hand in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How naughty you are to-night! And what temper you are showing toward poor
      Serge! What an opinion he will have of himself after your displaying such
      a flattering scene of jealousy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne drew away her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t try to joke. This is not the moment, I assure you. You don&rsquo;t
      exactly realize your situation. Don&rsquo;t you understand that I am prepared to
      tell Madame Desvarennes everything&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything!&rdquo; said the Prince. &ldquo;In truth, it would not amount to much. You
      would tell her that I met you in England; that I courted you, and that you
      found my attentions agreeable. And then? It pleases you to think too
      seriously of that midsummer night&rsquo;s dream under the great trees of
      Churchill Castle, and you reproach me for my errors! But what are they?
      Seriously, I do not see them! We lived in a noisy world; where we enjoyed
      the liberty which English manners allow to young people. Your aunt found
      no fault with the charming chatter which the English call flirtation. I
      told you I loved you; you allowed me to think that I was not displeasing
      to you. We, thanks to that delightful agreement, spent a most agreeable
      summer, and now you do not wish to put an end to that pleasant little
      excursion made beyond the limits drawn by our Parisian world, so severe,
      whatever people say about it. It is not reasonable, and it is imprudent.
      If you carry out your menacing propositions, and if you take my future
      mother-in-law as judge of the rights which you claim, don&rsquo;t you understand
      that you would be condemned beforehand? Her interests are directly opposed
      to yours. Could she hesitate between her daughter and you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! your calculations are clever and your measures were well taken,&rdquo;
       replied Jeanne. &ldquo;Still, if Madame Desvarennes were not the woman you think
      her&mdash;&rdquo; Then, hesitating:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she took my part, and thinking that he who was an unloyal lover would
      be an unfaithful husband&mdash;she would augur of the future of her
      daughter by my experience; and what would happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply this,&rdquo; returned Serge. &ldquo;Weary of the precarious and hazardous life
      which I lead, I would leave for Austria, and rejoin the service. A uniform
      is the only garb which can hide poverty honorably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne looked at him with anguish; and making an effort said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, in any case, for me it is abandonment?&rdquo; And falling upon a seat,
      she hid her face in her hands. Panine remained silent for a moment. The
      young girl&rsquo;s, grief, which he knew to be sincere, troubled him more than
      he wished to show. He had loved Mademoiselle de Cernay, and he loved her
      still. But he felt that a sign of weakness on his part would place him at
      Jeanne&rsquo;s mercy, and that an avowal from his lips at this grave moment
      meant a breaking-off of his marriage with Micheline. He hardened himself
      against his impressions, and replied, with insinuating sweetness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you speak of desertion, when a good man who loves you fondly, and
      who possesses a handsome fortune, wishes to marry you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Cernay raised her head, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, it is you who advise me to marry Monsieur Cayrol? Is there nothing
      revolting to you in the idea that I should follow your advice? But then,
      you deceived me from the first moment you spoke to me. You have never
      loved me even for a day! Not an hour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge smiled, and resuming his light, caressing tone, replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Jeanne, if I had a hundred thousand francs a year, I give you my
      word of honor that I would not marry another woman but you, for you would
      make an adorable Princess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Cernay made a gesture of perfect indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! what does the title matter to me?&rdquo; she exclaimed, with passion. &ldquo;What
      I want is you! Nothing but you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not know what you ask. I love you far too much to associate you
      with my destiny. If you knew that gilded misery, that white kid-gloved
      poverty, which is my lot, you would be frightened, and you would
      understand that in my resolution to give you up there is much of
      tenderness and generosity. Do you think it is such an easy matter to give
      up a woman so adorable as you are? I resign myself to it, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could I do with my beautiful Jeanne in the three rooms in the Rue de
      Madame where I live? Could I, with the ten or twelve thousand francs which
      I receive through the liberality of the Russian Panines, provide a home? I
      can hardly make it do for myself. I live at the club, where I dine
      cheaply. I ride my friends&rsquo; horses! I never touch a card, although I love
      play. I go much in society; I shine there, and walk home to save the cost
      of a carriage. My door-keeper cleans my rooms and keeps my linen in order.
      My private life is sad, dull, and humiliating. It is the black chrysalis
      of the bright butterfly which you know. That is what Prince Panine is, my
      dear Jeanne. A gentleman of good appearance, who lives as carefully as an
      old maid. The world sees him elegant and happy, and its envies his luxury;
      but this luxury is as deluding as watch-chains made of pinchbeck. You
      understand now that I cannot seriously ask you to share such an
      existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But if, with this sketch of his life, correctly described, Panine thought
      to turn the young girl against him, he was mistaken. He had counted
      without considering Jeanne&rsquo;s sanguine temperament, which would lead her to
      make any sacrifices to keep the man she adored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were rich, Serge,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I would not have made an effort to
      bring you back to me. But you are poor and I have a right to tell you that
      I love you. Life with you would be all devotedness and self-denial. Each
      pain endured would be a proof of love, and that is why I wish to suffer.
      Your life with mine would be neither sad nor humiliated; I would make it
      sweet by my tenderness, and bright by my happiness. And we should be so
      happy that you would say, &lsquo;How could I ever have dreamed of anything
      else?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! Jeanne,&rdquo; replied the Prince; &ldquo;it is a charming and poetic idyl
      which you present to me. We should flee far from the world, eh? We should
      go to an unknown spot and try to regain paradise lost. How long would that
      happiness last? A season during the springtime of our youth. Then autumn
      would come, sad and harsh. Our illusions would vanish like the swallows in
      romances, and we should find, with alarm, that we had taken the dream of a
      day for eternal happiness! Forgive my speaking plain words of
      disenchantment,&rdquo; added Serge, seeing Jeanne rising abruptly, &ldquo;but our life
      is being settled at this moment. Reason alone should guide us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I beseech you to be guided only by your heart,&rdquo; cried Mademoiselle de
      Cernay, seizing the hands of the Prince, and pressing them with her
      trembling fingers. &ldquo;Remember that you loved me. Say that you love me
      still!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne had drawn near to Serge. Her burning face almost touched his. Her
      eyes, bright with excitement, pleaded passionately for a tender look. She
      was most fascinating, and Panine, usually master of himself, lost his
      presence of mind for a moment. His arms encircled the shoulders of the
      adorable pleader, and his lips were buried in the masses of her dark hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serge!&rdquo; cried Mademoiselle de Cernay, clinging to him whom she loved so
      fondly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Prince was as quickly calmed as he had been carried away. He
      gently put Jeanne aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said with a smile, &ldquo;how unreasonable we are and how easily
      we might commit an irreparable folly. And yet our means will not allow
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In mercy do not leave me!&rdquo; pleaded Jeanne, in a tone of despair. &ldquo;You
      love me! I feel it; everything tells me so! And you would desert me
      because you are poor and I am not rich. Is a man ever poor when he has two
      arms? Work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word was uttered by Jeanne with admirable energy. She possessed the
      courage to overcome every difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge trembled. For the second time he felt touched to the very soul by
      this strange girl. He understood that he must not leave her with the
      slightest hope of encouragement, but throw ice on the fire which was
      devouring her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Jeanne,&rdquo; he said, with affectionate sweetness, &ldquo;you are talking
      nonsense. Remember this, that for Prince Panine there are only three
      social conditions possible: to be rich, a soldier, or a priest. I have the
      choice. It is for you to decide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This put an end to Mademoiselle de Cernay&rsquo;s resistance. She felt how
      useless was further argument, and falling on a sofa, crushed with grief,
      cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! this time it is finished; I am lost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Panine, then, approaching her, insinuating and supple, like the serpent
      with the first woman, murmured in her ear, as if afraid lest his words, in
      being spoken aloud, would lose their subtle venom:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you are not lost. On the contrary, you are saved, if you will only
      listen to and understand me. What are we, you and I? You, a child adopted
      by a generous woman; I, a ruined nobleman. You live in luxury, thanks to
      Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s liberality. I can scarcely manage to keep myself with
      the help of my family. Our present is precarious, our future hazardous.
      And, suddenly, fortune is within our grasp. We have only to stretch out
      our hands, and with one stroke we gain the uncontested power which money
      brings!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Riches, that aim of humanity! Do you understand? We, the weak and
      disdained, become strong and powerful. And what is necessary to gain them?
      A flash of sense; a minute of wisdom; forget a dream and accept a
      reality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne waited till he had finished. A bitter smile played on her lips.
      Henceforth she would believe in no one. After listening to what Serge had
      just said, she could listen to anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the dream is love; the reality is interest. And is it you
      who speak thus to me? You, for whom I was prepared to endure any
      sacrifice! You, whom I would have served on my knees! And what reason do
      you give to justify your conduct? Money! Indispensable and stupid money!
      Nothing but money! But it is odious, infamous, low!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge received this terrible broadside of abuse without flinching. He had
      armed himself against contempt, and was deaf to all insults. Jeanne went
      on with increasing rage:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Micheline has everything: family, fortune, and friends, and she is taking
      away my one possession&mdash;your love. Tell me that you love her! It will
      be more cruel but less vile! But no, it is not possible! You gave way to
      temptation at seeing her so rich; you had a feeling of covetousness, but
      you will become yourself again and will act like an honest man. Think,
      that in my eyes you are dishonoring yourself! Serge, answer me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She clung to him again, and tried to regain him by her ardor, to warm him
      with her passion. He remained unmoved, silent, and cold. Her conscience
      rebelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;marry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She remained silent and sullen, seeming to forget he was there. She was
      thinking deeply. Then she walked wildly up and down the room, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, it is that implacable self-interest with which I have just come in
      contact, which is the law of the world, the watchword of society! So, in
      refusing to share the common folly, I risk remaining in isolation, and I
      must be strong to make others stand in awe of me. Very well, then, I shall
      henceforth act in such a manner as to be neither dupe nor victim. In
      future, everything will be: self, and woe to him who hinders me. That is
      the morality of the age, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she laughed nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I not stupid? Come, Prince, you have made me clever. Many thanks for
      the lesson; it was difficult, but I shall profit by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince, astonished at the sudden change, listened to Jeanne with
      stupor. He did not yet quite understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you intend to do?&rdquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne looked at him with a fiendish expression. Her eyes sparkled like
      stars; her white teeth shone between her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intend,&rdquo; replied she, &ldquo;to lay the foundation of my power, and to follow
      your advice, by marrying a millionaire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ran to the window, and, looking out toward the shady garden, called:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Cayrol!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge, full of surprise, and seized by a sudden fit of jealousy, went
      toward her as if to recall her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jeanne,&rdquo; said he, vaguely holding out his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! what is it?&rdquo; she asked, with crushing haughtiness. &ldquo;Are you
      frightened at having gained your cause so quickly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as Serge did not speak:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; added she, &ldquo;you will have a handsome fee; Micheline&rsquo;s dower will
      be worth the trouble you have had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They heard Cayrol&rsquo;s hurried steps ascending the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done me the honor to call me, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said he, remaining
      on the threshold of the drawing-room. &ldquo;Am I fortunate enough at length to
      have found favor in your eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is my hand,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle de Cernay, simply tendering him her
      white taper fingers, which he covered with kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes had come in behind the banker. She uttered a joyous
      exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cayrol, you shall not marry Jeanne for her beauty alone. I will give her
      a dower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Micheline fell on her companion&rsquo;s neck. It was a concert of
      congratulations. But Jeanne, with a serious air, led Cayrol aside:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to act honestly toward you, sir; I yield to the pleading of which
      I am the object. But you must know that my sentiments do not change so
      quickly. It is my hand only which I give you today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not the conceitedness to think that you love me, Mademoiselle,&rdquo;
       said Cayrol, humbly. &ldquo;You give me your hand; it will be for me to gain
      your heart, and with time and sincere affection I do not despair of
      winning it. I am truly happy, believe me, for the favor you do me, and all
      my life long shall be spent in proving my gratitude to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne was moved; she glanced at Cayrol, and did not think him so
      common-looking as usual. She resolved to do all in her power to like this
      good man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge, in taking leave of Madame Desvarennes, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In exchange for all the happiness which you give me, I have only my life
      to offer; accept it, Madame, it is yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mistress looked at the Prince deeply; then, in a singular tone, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept it; from to-day you belong to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marechal took Pierre by the arm and led him outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Prince has just uttered words which remind me of Antonio saying to
      the Jew in &lsquo;The Merchant of Venice&rsquo;: &lsquo;Thy ducats in exchange for a pound
      of my flesh.&rsquo; Madame Desvarennes loves her daughter with a more formidable
      love than Shylock had for his gold. The Prince will do well to be exact in
      his payments of the happiness which he has promised.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. A PLEASANT UNDERSTANDING
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day following this memorable evening, Pierre left for Algeria,
      notwithstanding the prayers of Madame Desvarennes who wished to keep him
      near her. He was going to finish his labors. He promised to return in time
      for the wedding. The mistress, wishing to give him some compensation,
      offered him the management of the mills at Jouy, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that if you are not my son, you will be at least my partner. And if I
      do not leave you all my money at my death, I can enrich you during my
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre would not accept. He would not have it said that in wishing to
      marry Micheline he had tried to make a speculation. He wished to leave
      that house where he had hoped to spend his life, empty-handed, so that no
      one could doubt that it was the woman he loved in Micheline and not the
      heiress. He had been offered a splendid appointment in Savoy as manager of
      some mines; he would find there at the same time profit and happiness,
      because there were interesting scientific studies to be made in order to
      enable him to carry on the work creditably. He resolved to throw himself
      heart and soul into the work and seek forgetfulness in study.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mansion of the Rue Saint-Dominique the marriage preparations were
      carried on with great despatch. On the one side the Prince, and on the
      other Cayrol, were eager for the day: the one because he saw the
      realization of his ambitious dreams, the other because he loved so madly.
      Serge, gracious and attentive, allowed himself to be adored by Micheline,
      who was never weary of listening to and looking at him whom she loved. It
      was a sort of delirium that had taken possession of the young girl. Madame
      Desvarennes looked on the metamorphosis in her child with amazement. The
      old Micheline, naturally indolent and cold, just living with the indolence
      of an odalisque stretched on silk cushions, had changed into a lively,
      loving sweetheart, with sparkling eyes and cheerful lips. Like those
      lowers which the sun causes to bloom and be fragrant, so Micheline under a
      look from Serge became animated and grown handsomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother looked on with bitterness; she spoke of this transformation in
      her child with ironical disdain, She was sure Micheline was not in
      earnest; only a doll was capable of falling in love so foolishly with a
      man for his personal beauty. For to her mind the Prince was as regards
      mental power painfully deficient. No sense, dumb as soon as the
      conversation took a serious turn, only able to talk dress like a woman, or
      about horses like a jockey. And it was such a person upon whom Micheline
      literally doted! The mistress felt humiliated; she dared not say anything
      to her daughter, but she relieved herself in company of Marechal, whose
      discretion she could trust, and whom she willingly called the tomb of her
      secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marechal listened patiently to the confidences of Madame Desvarennes, and
      he tried to fight against the growing animosity of the mistress toward her
      future son-in-law. Not that he liked the Prince&mdash;he was too much on
      Pierre&rsquo;s side to be well disposed toward Panine; but with his good sense
      he saw that Madame Desvarennes would find it advantageous to overcome her
      feeling of dislike. And when the mistress, so formidable toward everybody
      except her daughter, cried with rage:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Micheline! I have just seen her again in the garden, hanging on the
      arm of that great lanky fellow, her eyes fixed on his like a lark
      fascinated by a looking-glass. What on earth has happened to her that she
      should be in such a state?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marechal interrupted her gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All fair people are like that,&rdquo; he affirmed with ironical gayety. &ldquo;You
      cannot understand it, Madame; you are dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Madame Desvarennes became angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are stupid! She ought to have a shower-bath!
      She is mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As for Cayrol he lived in ecstasy, like an Italian kneeling before a
      madonna. He had never been so happy; he was overwhelmed with joy. Until
      then, he had only thought of business matters. To be rich was the aim of
      his life; and now he was going to work for happiness. It was all pleasure
      for him. He was not blase; he amused himself like a child, adorning the
      rooms which were to be occupied by Jeanne. To his mind nothing was too
      expensive for the temple of his goddess, as he said, with a loud laugh
      which lighted up his whole face. And when he spoke of his love&rsquo;s future
      nest, he exclaimed, with a voluptuous shiver:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is charming; a veritable little paradise!&rdquo; Then the financier shone
      through all, and he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I know what it costs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he did not grudge his money. He knew he would get the interest of it
      back. On one subject he was anxious&mdash;Mademoiselle de Cernay&rsquo;s health.
      Since the day of their engagement, Jeanne had become more serious and
      dull. She had grown thin and her eyes were sunken as if she wept in
      secret. When he spoke of his fears to Madame Desvarennes, the latter said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These young girls are so senseless. The notion of marriage puts them in
      such an incomprehensible state! Look at my daughter. She chatters like a
      magpie and skips about like a kid. She has two glow-worms under her
      eyelids! As to Jeanne, that&rsquo;s another affair; she has the matrimonial
      melancholy, and has the air of a young victim. Leave them alone; it will
      all come right. But you must admit that the gayety of the one is at least
      as irritating as the languor of the other!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol, somewhat reassured by this explanation, and thinking, like her,
      that it was the uncertainties of marriage which were troubling Jeanne, no
      longer attached any importance to her sad appearance. Micheline and Serge
      isolated themselves completely. They fled to the garden as soon as any one
      ventured into the drawing room, to interrupt their tete-a-tete. If
      visitors came to the garden they took refuge in the conservatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      This manoeuvre pleased Serge, because he always felt uncomfortable in
      Jeanne&rsquo;s presence. Mademoiselle de Cernay had a peculiar wrinkle on her
      brow whenever she saw Micheline passing before her hanging on the arm of
      the Prince, which tormented him. They were obliged to meet at table in the
      evening, for Serge and Cayrol dined at the Rue Saint-Dominique. The Prince
      talked in whispers to Micheline, but every now and then he was obliged to
      speak to Jeanne. These were painful moments to Serge. He was always in
      dread of some outburst, knowing her ardent and passionate nature. Thus,
      before Jeanne, he made Micheline behave in a less demonstrative manner.
      Mademoiselle Desvarennes was proud of this reserve, and thought it was
      tact and good breeding on the part of the Prince, without doubting that
      what she thought reserve in the man of the world was the prudence of an
      anxious lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne endured the tortures of Hades. Too proud to say anything after the
      explanation she had had with Serge, too much smitten to bear calmly the
      sight of her rival&rsquo;s happiness, she saw draw near with deep horror the
      moment when she would belong to the man whom she had determined to marry
      although she did not love him. She once thought of breaking off the
      engagement; as she could not belong to the man whom she adored, at least
      she could belong to herself. But the thought of the struggle she would
      have to sustain with those who surrounded her, stopped her. What would she
      do at Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s? She would have to witness the happiness of
      Micheline and Serge. She would rather leave the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Cayrol at least she could go away; she would be free, and perhaps the
      esteem which she would surely have for her husband would do instead of
      love. Sisterly or filial love, in fact the least affection, would satisfy
      the poor man, who was willing to accept anything from Jeanne. And she
      would not have that group of Serge and Micheline before her eyes, always
      walking round the lawn and disappearing arm in arm down the narrow walks.
      She would not have the continual murmur of their love-making in her ears,
      a murmur broken by the sound of kisses when they reached shady corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, when Serge appeared in the little drawing-room of the Rue
      Saint-Dominique, he found Madame Desvarennes alone. She looked serious, as
      if same important business were pending. She stood before the fireplace;
      her hands crossed behind her back like a man. Apparently, she had sought
      to be alone. Cayrol, Jeanne, and Micheline were in the garden. Serge felt
      uneasy. He had a presentiment of trouble. But determined to make the best
      of it, whatever it might be, he looked pleasant and bowed to Madame
      Desvarennes, without his face betraying his uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day, Prince; you are early this evening, though not so early as
      Cayrol; but then he does not quite know what he is doing now. Sit down, I
      want to talk to you. You know that a young lady like Mademoiselle
      Desvarennes cannot get married without her engagement being much talked
      about. Tongues have been very busy, and pens too. I have heard a lot of
      scandal and have received heaps of anonymous letters about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge gave a start of indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be uneasy,&rdquo; continued the mistress. &ldquo;I did not heed the tales, and
      I burned the letters. Some said you were a dissolute man, capable of
      anything to gain your object. Others insinuated that you were not a
      Prince, that you were not a Pole, but the son of a Russian coachman and a
      little dressmaker of Les Ternes; that you had lived at the expense of
      Mademoiselle Anna Monplaisir, the star of the Varietes Theatre, and that
      you were bent on marrying to pay your debts with my daughter&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Panine, pale as death, rose up and said, in a stifled voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, my dear child,&rdquo; interrupted the mistress. &ldquo;If I tell you these
      things, it is because I have the proofs that they are untrue. Otherwise, I
      would not have given myself the trouble to talk to you about them. I would
      have shown you the door and there would have been an end of it. Certainly,
      you are not an angel; but the peccadillos which you have been guilty of
      are those which one forgives in a son, and which in a son-in-law makes
      some mothers smile. You are a Prince, you are handsome, and you have been
      loved. You were then a bachelor; and it was your own affair. But now, you
      are going to be, in about ten days, the husband of my daughter, and it is
      necessary for us to make certain arrangements. Therefore, I waited to see
      you, to speak of your wife, of yourself, and of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What Madame Desvarennes had just said relieved Serge of a great weight. He
      felt so happy that he resolved to do everything in his power to please the
      mother of his betrothed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, Madame,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I am listening to you with attention and
      confidence. I am sure that from you I can only expect goodness and sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mistress smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know you have a gilt tongue, my handsome friend, but I don&rsquo;t pay
      myself with words, and I, am not easy to be wheedled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; said Serge, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t deceive you. I will try to please you with
      all my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s face brightened as suddenly at these words as a
      landscape, wrapped in a fog, which is suddenly lighted up by the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we shall understand each other,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;For the last fortnight
      we have been busy with marriage preparations, and have not been able to
      think or reason. Everybody is rambling about here. Still, we are
      commencing a new life, and I think it is as well to lay the foundation. I
      seem to be drawing up a contract, eh? What can I do? It is an old business
      habit. I like to know how I stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is quite right. I think, too, that you have acted with great
      delicacy in not imposing your conditions upon me before giving your
      consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has that made you feel better disposed toward me? So much the better!&rdquo;
       said the mistress. &ldquo;Because you know that I depend on my daughter, who
      will henceforth depend on you, and it is to my interest that I should be
      in your good graces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In pronouncing these words with forced cheerfulness, Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s
      voice trembled slightly. She knew what an important game she was playing,
      and wished to win it at any price.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;I am not an easy woman to deal with. I am a
      little despotic, I know. I have been in the habit of commanding during the
      last thirty-five years. Business was heavy, and required a strong will. I
      had it, and the habit is formed. But this strong will, which has served me
      so well in business will, I am afraid, with you, play me some trick. Those
      who have lived with me a long time know that if I am hot-headed I have a
      good heart. They submit to my tyranny; but you who are a newcomer, how
      will you like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall do as the others do,&rdquo; said Serge, simply. &ldquo;I shall be led, and
      with pleasure. Think that I have lived for years without kindred, without
      ties&mdash;at random; and, believe me, any chain will be light and sweet
      which holds me to any one or anything. And then,&rdquo; frankly added he,
      changing his tone and looking at Madame Desvarennes with tenderness, &ldquo;if I
      did not do everything to please you I should be ungrateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Madame Desvarennes, &ldquo;unfortunately that is not a reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you have a better one?&rdquo; said the young man, in his most charming
      accent. &ldquo;If I had not married your daughter for her own sake, I believe
      that I should have married her for yours.&rdquo; Madame Desvarennes was quite
      pleased, and shaking her finger threateningly at Serge, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you Pole, you boaster of the North!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seriously,&rdquo; continued Serge, &ldquo;before I knew I was to be your son-in-law,
      I thought you a matchless woman. Add to the admiration I had for your
      great qualities the affection which your goodness has inspired, and you
      will understand that I am both proud and happy to have such a mother as
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes looked at Panine attentively; she saw he was sincere.
      Then, taking courage, she touched the topic of greatest interest to her.
      &ldquo;If that is the case, you will have no objections to live with me?&rdquo; She
      stopped; then emphasized the words, &ldquo;With me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But was not that understood?&rdquo; asked Serge, gayly&rsquo; &ldquo;I thought so. You must
      have seen that I have not been seeking a dwelling for my wife and myself.
      If you had not made the offer to me, I should have asked you to let me
      stay with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes broke into such an outburst of joy that she astonished
      Panine. It was then only that in that pallor, in that sudden trembling, in
      that changed voice, he understood, the immensity of the mother&rsquo;s love for
      her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have everything to gain by that arrangement,&rdquo; continued he. &ldquo;My wife
      will be happy at not leaving you, and you will be pleased at my not having
      taken away your daughter. You will both like me better, and that is all I
      wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good you are in deciding thus, and how I thank you for it,&rdquo; resumed
      Madame Desvarennes. &ldquo;I feared you would have ideas of independence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have been happy to sacrifice them to you, but I have not even
      that merit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All that Serge had said had been so open and plain, and expressed with
      such sweetness that, little by little, Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s prejudices
      disappeared. He took possession of her as he had done of Micheline, and as
      he did of every one whom he wished to conquer. His charm was irresistible.
      He seized on one by the eyes and the ears. Naturally fascinating, moving,
      captivating, bold, he always preserved his artless and tender ways, which
      made him resemble a young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to tell you how we shall manage,&rdquo; said the mistress.
      &ldquo;Foreseeing my daughter&rsquo;s marriage, I have had my house divided into two
      distinct establishments. They say that life in common with a mother-in-law
      is objectionable to a son-in-law, therefore I wish you to have a home of
      your own. I know that an old face like mine frightens young lovers. I will
      come to you when you invite me. But even when I am shut up in my own
      apartments I shall be with my daughter; I shall breathe the same air; I
      shall hear her going and coming, singing, laughing, and I shall say to
      myself, &lsquo;It is all right, she is happy.&rsquo; That is all I ask. A little
      corner, whence I can share her life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge took her hand with effusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid; your daughter will not leave you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes, unable to contain her feelings, opened her arms, and
      Serge fell on her breast, like a true son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, I am going to adore you!&rdquo; cried Madame Desvarennes, showing
      Panine a face beaming with happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said the young man, gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes became thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a strange thing life is!&rdquo; resumed she. &ldquo;I did not want you for a
      son-in-law, and now you are behaving so well toward me that I am full of
      remorse. Oh, I see now what a dangerous man you are, if you captivate
      other women&rsquo;s hearts as you have caught mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the Prince fixedly, and added, in her clear commanding
      voice, with a shade of gayety:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I hope you will reserve all your powers of charming for my daughter.
      No more flirting, eh? She loves you; she would be jealous, and you would
      get into hot water with me! Let Micheline&rsquo;s life be happy, without a
      cloud-blue, always blue sky!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be easy,&rdquo; said Serge. &ldquo;To be unhappy I should have to seek
      misfortune; and I certainly shall not do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, your good friends who criticised so when you gave me Micheline&rsquo;s
      hand would be only too pleased. I will not give them the pleasure of
      posing as prophets and saying, &lsquo;We knew it would be so!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must forgive them,&rdquo; replied Madame Desvarennes. &ldquo;You have made
      enemies. Without speaking of projects which I had formed, I may say that
      my daughter has had offers from the best folks in Paris; from first-rate
      firms! Our circle was rather indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People said: &lsquo;Oh, Madame Desvarennes wanted her daughter to be a
      Princess. We shall see how it will turn out. Her son-in-law will spend her
      money and spurn her.&rsquo; The gossip of disappointed people. Give them the
      lie; manage that we shall all live together, and we shall be right against
      the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hope it will be so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of it,&rdquo; answered the mistress, affectionately pressing the hand
      of her future son-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Micheline entered, anxious at the long interview between Serge and her
      mother. She saw them hand in hand. She uttered a joyful cry, and threw her
      arms caressingly round her mother&rsquo;s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! you are agreed?&rdquo; she said, making a gracious sign to Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been charming,&rdquo; replied Madame Desvarennes, whispering in her
      daughter&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;He agrees to live in this house, and that quite
      gracefully. There, child, this is the happiest moment I&rsquo;ve had since your
      engagement. I admit that I regret nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, resuming aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will leave to-morrow for Cernay, where the marriage shall take place.
      I shall have to order the workmen in here to get ready for your reception.
      Besides the wedding will be more brilliant in the country. We shall have
      all the work-people there. We will throw the park open to the countryside;
      it will be a grand fete. For we are lords of the manor there,&rdquo; added she,
      with pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, mamma; it will be far better,&rdquo; exclaimed Micheline. And
      taking Serge by the hand:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, let us go,&rdquo; said she, and led him into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      And amid the sweet-smelling shrubs they resumed their walk, always the
      same yet ever new, their arms twined round each other, the young girl
      clinging to him whom she loved, and he looking fondly at her, and with
      caressing voice telling her the oft-told tale of love which she was never
      tired of hearing, and which always filled her with thrills of joy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. THE DOUBLE MARRIAGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Chateau of Cernay is a vast and beautiful structure of the time of
      Louis XIII. A walled park of a hundred acres surrounds it, with trees
      centuries old. A white painted gate separates the avenue from the road
      leading to Pontoise by way of Conflans. A carpet of grass, on which
      carriages roll as if on velvet, leads up to the park gates. Before
      reaching, it there is a stone bridge which spans the moat of running
      water. A lodge of stone, faced with brick, with large windows, rises at
      each corner of this space.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chateau, surrounded by cleverly arranged trees, stands in the centre,
      on a solid foundation of red granite from the Jura. A splendid double
      staircase leads to the ground floor as high as an &lsquo;entresol&rsquo;. A spacious
      hall, rising to the roof of the building, lighted by a window filled with
      old stained glass, first offers itself to the visitor. A large organ, by
      Cavallie-Col, rears its long brilliant pipes at one end of the hall to a
      level with the gallery of sculptured wood running round and forming a
      balcony on the first floor. At each corner is a knight in armor, helmet on
      head, and lance in hand, mounted on a charger, and covered with the heavy
      trappings of war. Cases full of objects of art of great value, bookshelves
      containing all the new books, are placed along the walls. A billiard-table
      and all sorts of games are lodged under the vast staircase. The broad bays
      which give admission to the reception-rooms and grand staircase are closed
      by tapestry of the fifteenth century, representing hunting scenes. Long
      cords of silk and gold loop back these marvellous hangings in the Italian
      style. Thick carpets, into which the feet sink, deaden the sound of
      footsteps. Spacious divans, covered with Oriental materials, are placed
      round the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the chimney-piece, which is splendidly carved in woodwork, is a
      looking-glass in the Renaissance style, with a bronze and silver frame,
      representing grinning fawns and dishevelled nymphs. Benches are placed
      round the hearth, which is large enough to hold six people. Above the
      divans, on the walls, are large oil-paintings by old masters. An
      &ldquo;Assumption,&rdquo; by Jordaens, which is a masterpiece; &ldquo;The Gamesters,&rdquo; by
      Valentin; &ldquo;A Spanish Family on Horseback,&rdquo; painted by Velasquez; and the
      marvel of the collection&mdash;a &ldquo;Holy Family,&rdquo; by Francia, bought in
      Russia. Then, lower down, &ldquo;A Young Girl with a Canary,&rdquo; by Metzu; a
      &ldquo;Kermesse,&rdquo; by Braurver, a perfect treasure, glitter, like the gems they
      are, in the midst of panoplies, between the high branches of palm-trees
      planted in enormous delft vases. A mysterious light filters into that
      fresh and picturesque apartment through the stained-glass windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the hall the left wing is reached, where the reception-rooms are, and
      one&rsquo;s eyes are dazzled by the brightness which reigns there. It is like
      coming out from a cathedral into broad daylight. The furniture, of gilt
      wood and Genoese velvet, looks very bright. The walls are white and gold;
      and flowers are everywhere. At the end is Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s bedroom,
      because she does not like mounting stairs, and lives on the ground floor.
      Adjoining it is a conservatory, furnished as a drawing-room, and serving
      as a boudoir for the mistress of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dining-room, the gun-room, and the smoking-room are in the right wing.
      The gun-room deserves a particular description. Four glass cases contain
      guns of every description and size of the best English and French
      manufacture. All the furniture is made of stags&rsquo; horns, covered with
      fox-skins and wolf-skins. A large rug, formed by four bears&rsquo; skins, with
      menacing snouts, showing their white teeth at the four corners, is in the
      centre of the room. On the walls are four paintings by Princeteau,
      admirably executed, and representing hunting scenes. Low couches, wide as
      beds, covered with gray cloth, invite the sportsmen to rest. Large
      dressing-rooms, fitted up with hot and cold water, invite them to refresh
      themselves with a bath. Everything has been done to suit the most
      fastidious taste. The kitchens are underground.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first story are the principal rooms. Twelve bedrooms, with
      dressing-rooms, upholstered in chintz of charming design. From these, a
      splendid view of the park and country beyond may be obtained. In the
      foreground is a piece of water, bathing, with its rapid current, the
      grassy banks which border the wood, while the low-lying branches of the
      trees dip into the flood, on which swans, dazzlingly white, swim in
      stately fashion. Beneath an old willow, whose drooping boughs form quite a
      vault of pale verdure, a squadron of multicolored boats remain fastened to
      the balustrade of a landing stage. Through an opening in the trees you see
      in the distance fields of yellow corn, and in the near background, behind
      a row of poplars, ever moving like a flash of silver lightning, the Oise
      flows on between its low banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sumptuous dwelling, on the evening of the 14th of July, was in its
      greatest splendor. The trees of the park were lit up by brilliant Venetian
      lanterns; little boats glided on the water of the lake carrying musicians
      whose notes echoed through the air. Under a marquee, placed midway in the
      large avenue, the country lads and lasses were dancing with spirit, while
      the old people, more calm, were seated under the large trees enjoying the
      ample fare provided. A tremendous uproar of gayety reechoed through the
      night, and the sound of the cornet attracted the people to the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nine o&rsquo;clock. Carriages were fast arriving with guests for the
      mansion. In the centre of the handsome hall, illuminated with electric
      light, stood Madame Desvarennes in full dress, having put off black for
      one day, doing honor to the arrivals. Behind her stood Marechal and
      Savinien, like two aides-de-camp, ready, at a sign, to offer their arms to
      the ladies, to conduct them to the drawing-rooms. The gathering was
      numerous. Merchant-princes came for Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s sake; bankers for
      Cayrol&rsquo;s; and the aristocrats and foreign nobility for the Prince&rsquo;s. An
      assemblage as opposed in ideas as in manners: some valuing only money,
      others high birth; all proud and elbowing each other with haughty
      assurance, speaking ill of each other and secretly jealous.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were heirs of dethroned kings; princes without portions, who were
      called Highness, and who had not the income of their fathers&rsquo; former
      chamberlains; millionaires sprung from nothing, who made a great show and
      who would have given half of their possessions for a single quartering of
      the arms of these great lords whom they affected to despise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge and Cayrol went from group to group; the one with his graceful and
      delicate elegance; the other with his good-humor, radiant and elated by
      the consciousness of his triumphs. Herzog had just arrived, accompanied by
      his daughter, a charming girl of sixteen, to whom Marechal had offered his
      arm. A whispering was heard when Herzog passed. He was accustomed to the
      effect which he produced in public, and quite calmly congratulated Cayrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge had just introduced Micheline to Count Soutzko, a gray-haired old
      gentleman of military appearance, whose right sleeve was empty. He was a
      veteran of the Polish wars, and an old friend of Prince Panine&rsquo;s, at whose
      side he had received the wounds which had so frightfully mutilated him.
      Micheline, smiling, was listening to flattering tales which the old
      soldier was relating about Serge. Cayrol, who had got rid of Herzog, was
      looking for Jeanne, who had just disappeared in the direction of the
      terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rooms were uncomfortably warm, and many of the visitors had found
      their way to the terraces. Along the marble veranda, overlooking the lake,
      chairs had been placed. The ladies, wrapped in their lace scarfs, had
      formed into groups and were enjoying the delights of the beautiful
      evening. Bursts of subdued laughter came from behind fans, while the
      gentlemen talked in whispers. Above all this whispering was heard the
      distant sound of the cornet at the peasants&rsquo; ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning over the balustrade, in a shady corner, far from the noise which
      troubled him and far from the fete which hurt him, Pierre was dreaming.
      His eyes were fixed on the illuminations in the park, but he did not see
      them. He thought of his vanished hopes. Another was beloved by Micheline,
      and in a few hours he would take her away, triumphant and happy. A great
      sadness stole over the young man&rsquo;s spirit; he was disgusted with life and
      hated humanity. What was to become of him now? His life was shattered; a
      heart like his could not love twice, and Micheline&rsquo;s image was too deeply
      engraven on it for it ever to be effaced. Of what use was all the trouble
      he had taken to raise himself above others? A worthless fellow had passed
      that way and Micheline had yielded to him. Now it was all over!
    </p>
    <p>
      And Pierre asked himself if he had not taken a wrong view of things, and
      if it was not the idle and good-for-nothing fellows who were more prudent
      than he. To waste his life in superhuman works, to tire his mind in
      seeking to solve great problems, and to attain old age without other
      satisfaction than unproductive honors and mercenary rewards. Those who
      only sought happiness and joy&mdash;epicureans who drive away all care,
      all pain, and only seek to soften their existence, and brighten their
      horizon&mdash;were they not true sages? Death comes so quickly! And it is
      with astonishment that one perceives when the hour is at hand, that one
      has not lived! Then the voice of pride spoke to him: what is a man who
      remains useless, and does not leave one trace of his passage through the
      world by works or discoveries? And, in a state of fever, Pierre said to
      himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will throw myself heart and soul into science; I will make my name
      famous, and I will make that ungrateful child regret me. She will see the
      difference between me and him whom she has chosen. She will understand
      that he is nobody, except by her money, whereas she would have been all by
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A hand was placed on his shoulder; and Marechal&rsquo;s affectionate voice said
      to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! what are you doing here, gesticulating like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lost in his thoughts he had not heard his friend approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All our guests have arrived,&rdquo; continued Marechal. &ldquo;I have only just been
      able to leave them and to come to you. I have been seeking you for more
      than a quarter of an hour. You are wrong to hide yourself; people will
      make remarks. Come toward the house; it is as well to show yourself a
      little; people might imagine things which they must not imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! let them think what they like; what does it matter to me?&rdquo; said
      Pierre, sadly. &ldquo;My life is a blank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your life may be a blank; but it is your duty not to let any one perceive
      it. Imitate the young Spartan, who smiled although the fox, hidden under
      his cloak, was gnawing his vitals. Let us avoid ridicule, my friend. In
      society there is nothing that provokes laughter more than a disappointed
      lover, who rolls his eyes about and looks woe-begone. And, then, you-see,
      suffering is a human law; the world is an arena, life is a conflict.
      Material obstacles, moral griefs, all hinder and overwhelm us. We must go
      on, though, all the same, and fight. Those who give in are trodden down!
      Come, pull yourself together!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for whom should I fight now? A moment ago I was making projects, but
      I was a fool! All hope and ambition are dead in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ambition will return, you may be sure! At present you are suffering from
      weariness of mind; but your strength will return. As to hope, one must
      never despair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I expect in the future?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Why, everything! In this world all sorts of things happen!&rdquo; said
      Marechal, gayly. &ldquo;Who is to prove that the Princess will not be a widow
      soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre could not help laughing and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, don&rsquo;t talk such nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; concluded Marechal, &ldquo;in life it is only nonsense that is
      common-sense. Come and smoke a cigar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They traversed several groups of people and bent their steps in the
      direction of the chateau. The Prince was advancing toward the terrace,
      with an elegantly dressed and beautiful woman on his arm. Savinien, in the
      midst of a circle of dandies, was picking the passers-by to pieces in his
      easy-going way. Pierre and Marechal came behind these young men without
      being noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that hanging on the arm of our dear Prince?&rdquo; asked a little fat
      man, girt in a white satin waistcoat, and a spray of white lilac in his
      buttonhole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! Why, Le Brede, my boy, you don&rsquo;t know anything!&rdquo; cried Savinien in a
      bantering, jocose tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t know that lovely fair woman?&rdquo; said Le Brede, in a piqued
      voice. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t profess to know the names of all the pretty women in
      Paris!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Paris? That woman from Paris? You have not looked at her. Come, open
      your eyes. Pure English style, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dandies roared with laughter. They had at once recognized the pure
      English style. They were not men to be deceived. One of them, a tall, dark
      fellow, named Du Tremblays, affected an aggrieved air, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Le Brede, my dear fellow, you make us blush for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince passed, smiling and speaking in a low voice to the beautiful
      Englishwoman, who was resting the tips of her white gloved fingers on her
      cavalier&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; inquired Le Brede, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, my dear fellow, it is Lady Harton, a cousin of the Prince. She is
      extremely rich, and owns a district in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say that a year ago she was very kind to Serge Panine,&rdquo; added Du
      Tremblays, confidentially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did he not marry her, then, since she is so rich? He has been quite a
      year in the market, the dear Prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is a good reason. But where is her husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up in a castle in Scotland. Nobody ever sees him. He is out of his
      mind; and is surrounded by every attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a strait-waistcoat! Then why does not this pretty woman get a
      divorce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The money belongs to the husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre and Marechal had listened, in silence, to this cool and yet
      terrible conversation. The group of young men dispersed. The two friends
      looked at each other. Thus, then, Serge Panine was judged by his
      companions in pleasure, by the frequenters of the clubs in which he had
      spent a part of his existence. The Prince being &ldquo;in the market&rdquo; was
      obliged to marry a rich woman. He could not marry Lady Harton, so he had
      sought Micheline. And the sweet child was the wife of such a man! And what
      could be done? She loved him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes and Micheline appeared on the terrace. Lady Harton
      pointed to the bride with her fan. The Prince, leaving his companion,
      advanced toward Micheline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of my English relatives, a Polish lady, married to Lord Harton,
      wishes to be introduced to you,&rdquo; said Serge. &ldquo;Are you agreeable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; replied the young wife, looking lovingly at her
      husband. &ldquo;All who belong to you are dear to me, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The beautiful Englishwoman approached slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Princess Panine!&rdquo; said Serge, gravely, introducing Micheline, who
      bowed gracefully. Then, with a shade of familiarity: &ldquo;Lady Harton!&rdquo;
       continued he, introducing his relative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very fond of your husband, Madame,&rdquo; said the Englishwoman. &ldquo;I hope
      you will allow me to love you also; and I beg you to grant me the favor of
      accepting this small remembrance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While speaking, she unfastened from her wrist a splendid bracelet with the
      inscription, Semper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge frowned and looked stern. Micheline, lowering her eyes, and awed by
      the Englishwoman&rsquo;s grandeur, timidly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept it, Madame, as a token of friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I recognize this bracelet, Madame,&rdquo; observed Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you gave it to me,&rdquo; replied Lady Harton, quietly. &ldquo;Semper&mdash;I
      beg your pardon, Madame, we Poles all speak Latin&mdash;Semper means
      &lsquo;Always!&rsquo; It is a great word. On your wife&rsquo;s arm this bracelet will be
      well placed. Au revoir, dear Prince. I wish you every happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And bowing to Micheline with a regal bow, Lady Harton took the arm of a
      tall young man whom she had beckoned, and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Micheline, amazed, looked at the bracelet sparkling on her white wrist.
      Without uttering a word Serge unfastened it, took it off his wife&rsquo;s arm,
      and advancing on the terrace, with a rapid movement flung it in the water.
      The bracelet gleamed in the night-air and made a brilliant splash; then
      the water resumed its tranquillity. Micheline, astonished, looked at
      Serge, who came toward her, and very humbly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young wife did not answer, but her eyes filled with tears; a smile
      brightened her lips, and hurriedly taking his arm, she led him into the
      drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dancing was going on there. The young ladies of Pontoise, and the cream of
      Creil, had come to the fete, bent on not losing such an opportunity of
      enjoying themselves. Under the watchful eyes of their mothers, who, decked
      out in grand array, were seated along the walls, they were gamboling, in
      spite of the stifling heat, with all the impetuosity of young provincials
      habitually deprived of the pleasures of the ballroom. Crossing the room,
      Micheline and Serge reached Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s boudoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was delightfully cool in there. Cayrol had taken refuge there with
      Jeanne, and Mademoiselle Susanne Herzog. This young girl felt
      uncomfortable at being a third party with the newly-married couple, and
      welcomed the arrival of the Prince and Micheline with pleasure. Her father
      had left her for a moment in Cayrol&rsquo;s care; but she had not seen him for
      more than an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the Prince, gayly, &ldquo;a little while ago, when I was
      passing through the rooms, I heard these words: &lsquo;Loan, discount,
      liquidation.&rsquo; Your father must have been there. Shall I go and seek him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be very grateful,&rdquo; said the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And turning lightly on his heels, happy to escape Jeanne&rsquo;s looks, Serge
      reentered the furnace. At once he saw Herzog seated in the corner of a
      bay-window with one of the principal stock-brokers of Paris. He was
      speaking. The Prince went straight up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry to draw you away from the sweets of conversation,&rdquo; said he,
      smiling; &ldquo;but your daughter is waiting for you, and is anxious at your not
      coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith! My daughter, yes. I will come and see you tomorrow,&rdquo; said he to
      his companion. &ldquo;We will talk over this association: there is much to be
      gained by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other, a man with a bloated face, and fair Dundreary whiskers, was
      eager to do business with him. Certainly the affair was good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear Prince, I am happy to be alone with you for a moment!&rdquo; said
      Herzog, with that familiarity which was one of his means of becoming
      intimate with people. &ldquo;I was going to compliment you! What a splendid
      position you have reached.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I have married a charming woman,&rdquo; replied the Prince, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what a fortune!&rdquo; insisted the financier. &ldquo;Ah, it is worthy of the lot
      of a great lord such as you are! Oh, you are like those masterpieces of
      art which need a splendidly carved frame! Well, you have your frame, and
      well gilt too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed and seemed pleased at Serge&rsquo;s happiness. He had taken one of
      his hands and was patting it softly between his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a very &lsquo;convenient&rsquo; mother-in-law, for instance,&rdquo; he went on,
      good-naturedly; &ldquo;but you are so charming! Only you could have, coaxed
      Madame Desvarennes, and you have succeeded. Oh! she likes you, my dear
      Prince; she told me so only a little while ago. You have won her heart. I
      don&rsquo;t know how you manage it, but you are irresistible! By the way, I was
      not there when the marriage contract was read, and I, forgot to ask
      Cayrol. Under what conditions are you married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince looked at Herzog with a look that was hardly friendly. But the
      financier appeared so indifferent, that Serge could not help answering
      him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife&rsquo;s fortune is settled on herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah! that is usual in Normandy!&rdquo; replied Herzog with a grave look. &ldquo;I
      was told Madame Desvarennes was a clever woman and she has proved it. And
      you signed the contract with your eyes shut, my dear Prince. It is
      perfect, just as a gentleman should do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said this with a good-natured air. Then, suddenly lifting his eyes, and
      with an ironical smile playing on his lips, he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are bowled out, my dear fellow, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; protested Serge with haughtiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry out; it is too late, and would be useless,&rdquo; replied the
      financier. &ldquo;Let me explain your position to you. Your hands are tied. You
      cannot dispose of a sou belonging to your wife without her consent. It is
      true, you have influence over her, happily for you. Still you must foresee
      that she will be guided by her mother. A strong woman, too, the mother!
      Ah, Prince, you have allowed yourself to be done completely. I would not
      have thought it of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge, nonplussed for a moment, regained his self-possession, and looked
      Herzog in the face:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what idea you have formed of me, sir, and I don&rsquo;t know what
      object you have in speaking thus to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My interest in you,&rdquo; interrupted the financier. &ldquo;You are a charming
      fellow: you please me much. With your tastes, it is possible that in a
      brief time you may be short of money. Come and see me: I will put you into
      the way of business. Au revoir, Prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And without giving Serge time to answer him, Herzog reached the boudoir
      where his daughter was waiting with impatience. Behind him came the Prince
      looking rather troubled. The financier&rsquo;s words had awakened importunate
      ideas in his mind. Was it true that he had been duped by Madame
      Desvarennes, and that the latter, while affecting airs of greatness and
      generosity, had tied him like a noodle to her daughter&rsquo;s apron-string? He
      made an effort to regain his serenity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Micheline loves me and all will be well,&rdquo; said he to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes joined the young married people. The rooms were
      clearing by degrees. Serge took Cayrol apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do to-night, my dear fellow?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know an apartment has been prepared for you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have already thanked Madame Desvarennes, but I mean to go back to
      Paris. Our little paradise is prepared for us, and I wish to enter it
      to-night. I have my carriage and horses here. I am taking away my wife
      post-haste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is an elopement,&rdquo; said Serge; gayly, &ldquo;quite in the style of the
      regency!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear Prince, that&rsquo;s how we bankers do it,&rdquo; said Cayrol, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then changing his tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, I vibrate, I am palpitating. I am hot and cold by turns. Just fancy,
      I have never loved before; my heart is whole, and I love to distraction!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge instinctively glanced at Jeanne. She was seated, looking sad and
      tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes, between Jeanne and Micheline, had her arms twined
      round the two young girls. Regret filled her eyes. The mother felt that
      the last moments of her absolute reign were near, and she was
      contemplating with supreme adoration these two children who had grown up
      around her like two fragile and precious flowers. She was saying to them,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the great day is over. You are both married. You don&rsquo;t belong to me
      any longer. How I shall miss you! This morning I had two children, and now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have four,&rdquo; interrupted Micheline. &ldquo;Why do you complain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t complain,&rdquo; retorted Madame Desvarennes, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; said Micheline, gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then going toward Jeanne:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are not speaking, you are so quiet; are you ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne shuddered, and made an effort to soften the hard lines on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing. A little fatigue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And emotion,&rdquo; added Micheline. &ldquo;This morning when we entered the church,
      at the sound of the organ, in the midst of flowers, surrounded by all our
      friends, I felt that I was whiter than my veil. And the crossing to my
      place seemed so long, I thought I should never get there. I did so,
      though. And now everybody calls me &lsquo;Madame&rsquo; and some call me &lsquo;Princess.&rsquo; 
      It amuses me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge had approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are a Princess,&rdquo; said he, smiling, &ldquo;and everybody must call you
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not mamma, nor Jeanne, nor you,&rdquo; said the young wife, quickly;
      &ldquo;always call me Micheline. It will be less respectful, but it will be more
      tender.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes could not resist drawing her daughter once more to her
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear child,&rdquo; she said with emotion, &ldquo;you need affection, as flowers need
      the sun! But I love you, there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped and added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she held out her hand to her son-in-law. Then changing the subject:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am thinking, Cayrol, as you are returning to Paris, you might take
      some orders for me which I will write out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Business? Even on my wedding-day?&rdquo; exclaimed Micheline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! my daughter, we must have flour,&rdquo; replied the mistress, laughing.
      &ldquo;While we are enjoying ourselves Paris eats, and it has a famous
      appetite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Micheline, leaving her mother, went to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serge, it is not yet late. Suppose we put in an appearance at the
      work-people&rsquo;s ball? I promised them, and the good folks will be so happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please. I am awaiting your orders. Let us make ourselves popular!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes had gone to her room. Carol took the opportunity of
      telling his coachman to drive round by the park to the door of the little
      conservatory and wait there. Thus, his wife and he would avoid meeting any
      one, and would escape the leave-taking of friends and the curiosity of
      lookers-on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Micheline went up to Jeanne, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you are going away quietly, dear, I shall not see you again this
      evening. Adieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with a happy smile, she kissed her. Then taking her husband&rsquo;s arm she
      led him toward the park.

      CHAPTER X. CAYROL&rsquo;S DISAPPOINTMENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jeanne left alone, watched them as they disappeared with the light and
      easy movements of lovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge, bending toward Micheline, was speaking tenderly. A rush of bitter
      feeling caused Jeanne&rsquo;s heart to swell. She was alone, she, while he whom
      she loved-her whole being revolted. Unhappy one! Why did she think of this
      man? Had she the right to do so now? She no longer belonged to herself.
      Another, who was as kind to her as Serge was ungrateful, was her husband.
      She thought thus in sincerity of heart. She wished to love Cayrol. Alas,
      poor Jeanne! She would load him with attentions and caresses! And Serge
      would be jealous, for he could never have forgotten her so soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her thoughts again turned to him whom she wished to forget. She made an
      effort, but in vain. Serge was uppermost; he possessed her. She was
      afraid. Would she never be able to break off the remembrance? Would his
      name be ever on her lips, his face ever before her eyes?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank heaven! she was about to leave. Travelling, and the sight of strange
      places other than those where she had lived near Serge, would draw her
      attention from the persecution she suffered. Her husband was about to take
      her away, to defend her. It was his duty, and she would help him with
      energy. With all the strength of her will she summoned Cayrol. She clung
      violently to him as a drowning person catches at a straw, with the vigor
      of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was between Jeanne and Cayrol a sympathetic communication. Mentally
      called by his wife, the husband appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! at last!&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol, surprised at this welcome, smiled. Jeanne, without noticing,
      added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Monsieur; are we leaving soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The banker&rsquo;s surprise increased. But as this surprise was decidedly an
      agreeable one he did not protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a moment, Jeanne, dear,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why this delay?&rdquo; asked the young wife, nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will understand. There are more than twenty carriages before the
      front door. Our coachman is driving round, and we will go out by the
      conservatory door without being seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; we will wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This delay displeased Jeanne. In the ardor of her resolution, in the first
      warmth of her struggle, she wished at once to put space between her and
      Serge. Unfortunately, Cayrol had thwarted this effort of proud revolt. She
      was vexed with him. He, without knowing the motives which actuated his
      wife, guessed that something had displeased her. He wished to change the
      current of her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were marvellously beautiful to-night,&rdquo; he said, approaching her
      gallantly. &ldquo;You were much admired, and I was proud of you. If you had
      heard my friends! It was a concert of congratulations: What a fortunate
      fellow that Cayrol is! He is rich; he has a charming wife! You see,
      Jeanne, thanks to you, in the eyes of all, my happiness is complete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne frowned, and without answering, shook her head haughtily. Cayrol
      continued, without noticing this forecast of a storm:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They envy me; and I can understand it! I would not change places with
      anybody. There, our friend Prince Panine is very happy; he has married a
      woman whom he loves and who adores him. Well, he is not happier than I
      am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne rose abruptly, and gave her husband a terrible look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur!&rdquo; she cried with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Cayrol, humbly; &ldquo;I appear ridiculous to you, but
      my happiness is stronger than I am, and I cannot hide my joy. You will see
      that I can be grateful. I will spend my life in trying to please you. I
      have a surprise for you to begin with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of surprise?&rdquo; asked Jeanne, with indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol rubbed his hands with a mysterious air. He was enjoying beforehand
      the pleasant surprise he had in store for his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think we are going to Paris to spend our honeymoon like ordinary
      folk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne started. Cayrol seemed unfortunate in his choice of words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not at all,&rdquo; continued the banker. &ldquo;Tomorrow I leave my offices. My
      customers may say what they like; I will leave my business, and we are
      off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne showed signs of pleasure. A flash of joy lit up her face. To go
      away, that was rest for her!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where shall we go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the surprise! You know that the Prince and his wife intend
      travelling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but they refused to say where they were going;&rdquo; interrupted Jeanne,
      with a troubled expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to me. They are going to Switzerland. Well, we shall join them
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne arose like a startled deer when it hears the sound of a gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Join them there!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; to continue the journey together. A party of four; two newly-married
      couples. It will be charming. I spoke to Serge on the subject. He objected
      at first, but the Princess came to my assistance. And when he saw that his
      wife and I were agreed, he commenced to laugh, and said: &lsquo;You wish it? I
      consent. Don&rsquo;t say anything more!&rsquo; It is all very well to talk of love&rsquo;s
      solitude; in about a fortnight, passed tete-a-tete, Serge will be glad to
      have us. We will go to Italy to see the lakes; and there, in a boat, all
      four, of us will have such pleasant times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol might have gone on talking for an hour, but Jeanne was not
      listening. She was thinking. Thus all the efforts which she had decided to
      make to escape from him whom she loved would be useless. An invincible
      fatality ever brought her toward him whom she was seeking to avoid. And it
      was her husband who was aiding this inevitable and execrable meeting. A
      bitter smile played on her lips. There was something mournfully comic in
      this stubbornness of Cayrol&rsquo;s, in throwing her in the way of Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol, embarrassed by Jeanne&rsquo;s silence, waited a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You are just like the Prince when I spoke
      to him on the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne turned away abruptly. Cayrol&rsquo;s comparison was too direct. His
      blunders were becoming wearisome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The banker, quite discomfited on seeing the effect of his words,
      continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You object to this journey? If so, I am willing to give it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young wife was touched by this humble servility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; she said, softly, &ldquo;I should be grateful to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had hoped to please you,&rdquo; said Cayrol. &ldquo;It is for me to beg pardon for
      having succeeded so badly. Let us remain in Paris. It does not matter to
      me what place we are in! Being near to you is all I desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He approached her, and, with beaming eyes, added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are so beautiful, Jeanne; and I have loved you so long a time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved away, full of a vague dread. Cayrol, very excitedly, put her
      cloak round her shoulders, and looking toward the door, added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The carriage is there, we can go now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne, much troubled, did not rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait another minute,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol smiled constrainedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little while ago you were hurrying me off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was true. But a sudden change had come over Jeanne. Her energy had
      given way. She felt very weary. The idea of going away with Cayrol, and of
      being alone with him in the carriage frightened her. She looked vaguely at
      her husband, and saw, in a sort of mist, this great fat man, with a
      protruding shirt-front, rolls of red flesh on his neck above his collar,
      long fat ears which only needed gold ear-rings, and his great hairy hands,
      on the finger of one of which shone the new wedding-ring. Then, in a rapid
      vision, she beheld the refined profile, the beautiful blue eyes, and the
      long, fair mustache of Serge. A profound sadness came over the young
      woman, and tears rushed to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with you? You are crying!&rdquo; exclaimed Cayrol,
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing; my nerves are shaken. I am thinking of this chateau which
      bears my name. Here I spent my youth, and here my father died. A thousand
      ties bind me to this dwelling, and I cannot leave it without being
      overcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another home awaits you, luxuriantly adorned,&rdquo; murmured Cayrol, &ldquo;and
      worthy of receiving you. It is there you will live henceforth with me,
      happy through me, and belonging to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, ardently supplicating her, he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go, Jeanne!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to take her in his arms, but the young wife disengaged herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me alone!&rdquo; she said, moving away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol looked at her in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? You are trembling and frightened!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to jest:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I so very terrible, then? Or is it the idea of leaving here that
      troubles you so much? If so, why did you not tell me sooner? I can
      understand things. Let us remain here for a few days, or as long as you
      like. I have arranged my affairs so as to be at liberty. Our little
      paradise can wait for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke pleasantly, but with an undercurrent of anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne came slowly to him, and calmly taking his hand, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not making any efforts to be so,&rdquo; retorted Cayrol, smiling. &ldquo;What do
      I ask? That you may be happy and satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, do you wish to please me?&rdquo; asked the young wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; exclaimed Cayrol, warmly, &ldquo;tell me how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Desvarennes will be very lonely tomorrow when her daughter will be
      gone. She will need consoling&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ah,&rdquo; said Cayrol, thinking that he understood, &ldquo;and you would like&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to remain some time with her. You could come every day and
      see us. I would be very grateful to you, and would love you very much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;!&rdquo; exclaimed Cayrol, much confounded, &ldquo;you
      cannot mean what you say, Jeanne! What, my dear? You wish me to return
      alone to Paris to-night? What would my servants say? You would expose me
      to ridicule!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Cayrol made a piteous face. Jeanne looked at him as she had never
      looked before. It made his blood boil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you be so very ridiculous for having been delicate and tender?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what tenderness has to do with it,&rdquo; cried Cayrol; &ldquo;on the
      contrary! But I love you. You don&rsquo;t seem to think it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prove it,&rdquo; replied Jeanne, more provokingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Cayrol lost all patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it in leaving you that I shall prove it? Really, Jeanne, I am disposed
      to be kind and to humor your whims, but on condition that they are
      reasonable. You seem to be making fun of me! If I give way on such
      important points on the day of our marriage, whither will you lead me? No;
      no! You are my wife. The wife must follow her husband; the law says so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it by law only that you wish to keep me? Have you forgotten what I
      told you when you made me an offer of marriage? It is my hand only which I
      give you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I answered you, that it would be my aim to gain your heart. Well, but
      give me the means. Come, dear,&rdquo; said the banker in a resolute tone, &ldquo;you
      take me for a child. I am not so simple as that! I know what this
      resistance means; charming modesty so long as it is not everlasting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne turned away without answering. Her face had changed its expression;
      it was hard and determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; continued Cayrol, &ldquo;you would make a saint lose patience. Come,
      answer me, what does this attitude mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young wife remained silent. She felt she could not argue any longer,
      and seeing no way out of her trouble, felt quite discouraged. Still she
      would not yield. She shuddered at the very idea of belonging to this man;
      she had never thought of the issue of this brutal and vulgar adventure.
      Now that she realized it, she felt terribly disgusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol anxiously watched the increasing anguish depicted on his wife&rsquo;s
      face. He had a presentiment that she was hiding something from him, and
      the thought nearly choked him. And, with this suspicion, his ingenuity
      came to his aid. He approached Jeanne, and said, affectionately:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, dear child, we are misleading one another; I in speaking too
      harshly, you in refusing to understand me. Forget that I am your husband;
      see in me only a friend and open your heart; your resistance hides a
      mystery. You have had some grief or have been deceived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne, softened, said, in a low tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me like that; leave me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; resumed Cayrol, quietly, &ldquo;we are beginning life; there must be no
      misunderstanding. Be frank, and you will find me indulgent. Come, young
      girls are often romantic. They picture an ideal; they fall in love with
      some one who does not return their love, which is sometimes even unknown
      to him who is their hero. Then, suddenly, they have to return to a
      reality. They find themselves face to face with a husband who is not the
      expected Romeo, but who is a good man, devoted, loving, and ready to heal
      the wounds he has not made. They are afraid of this husband; they mistrust
      him, and will not follow him. It is wrong, because it is near him, in
      honorable and right existence, that they find peace and forgetfulness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol&rsquo;s heart was torn by anxiety, and with trembling voice he tried to
      read the effect of his words on Jeanne&rsquo;s features. She had turned away.
      Cayrol bent toward her and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t answer me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as she still remained silent, he took her hand and forced her to look
      at him. He saw that her face was covered with tears. He shuddered, and
      then flew into a terrible passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are crying! It is true then? You have loved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne rose with a bound; she saw her imprudence. She understood the trap
      he had laid; her cheeks burned. Drying her tears, she turned toward
      Cayrol, and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has said so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot deceive me,&rdquo; replied the banker, violently. &ldquo;I saw it in your
      looks. Now, I want to know the man&rsquo;s name!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne looked him straight in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that is an avowal!&rdquo; exclaimed Cayrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have deceived me unworthily by your pretended kindness,&rdquo; interrupted
      Jeanne, proudly, &ldquo;I will not say anything more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol flew at her&mdash;the churl reappeared. He muttered a fearful oath,
      and seizing her by the arm, shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care! Don&rsquo;t play with me. Speak, I insist, or&mdash;&rdquo; and he shook
      her brutally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne, indignant, screamed and tore herself away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you fill me with horror!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The husband, beside himself, pale as death and trembling convulsively,
      could not utter a word, and was about to rush upon her when the door
      opened, and Madame Desvarennes appeared, holding in her hand the letters
      which she had written for Cayrol to take back to Paris. Jeanne uttered a
      cry of joy, and with a bound threw herself into the arms of her who had
      been a mother to her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. CONFESSION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes understood the situation at a glance. She beheld Cayrol
      livid, tottering, and excited. She felt Jeanne trembling on her breast;
      she saw something serious had occurred. She calmed herself and put on a
      cold manner to enable her the better to suppress any resistance that they
      might offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; she asked, looking severely at Cayrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something quite unexpected,&rdquo; replied the banker, laughing nervously.
      &ldquo;Madame refuses to follow me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for what reason?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She dare not speak!&rdquo; Cayrol resumed, whose excitement increased as he
      spoke. &ldquo;It appears she has in her heart an unhappy love! And as I do not
      resemble the dreamed-of type, Madame has repugnances. But you understand
      the affair is not going to end there. It is not usual to come and say to a
      husband, twelve hours after marriage, &lsquo;Sir, I am very sorry, but I love
      somebody else!&rsquo; It would be too convenient. I shall not lend myself to
      these whims.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cayrol, oblige me by speaking in a lower tone,&rdquo; said Madame Desvarennes,
      quietly. &ldquo;There is some misunderstanding between you and this child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The husband shrugged his broad shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A misunderstanding? Faith! I think so! You have a delicacy of language
      which pleases me! A misunderstanding! Say rather a shameful deception! But
      I want to know the gentleman&rsquo;s name. She will have to speak. I am not a
      scented, educated gentleman. I am a peasant, and if I have to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; said Madame Desvarennes, sharply tapping with the tips of her
      fingers Cayrol&rsquo;s great fist which he held menacingly like a butcher about
      to strike. Then, taking him quietly aside toward the window, she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a fool to go on like this! Go to my room for a moment. To you,
      now, she will not say anything; to me she will confide all and we shall
      know what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol&rsquo;s face brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes, as ever, you are right. You must excuse
      rile, I do not know how to talk to women. Rebuke her and put a little
      sense in her head. But don&rsquo;t leave her; she is fit to commit any folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be easy,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And making a sign to Cayrol, who was leaving the room, she returned to
      Jeanne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my child, compose yourself. We are alone and you will tell me what
      happened. Among women we understand each other. Come, you were frightened,
      eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne was one petrified, immovable, and dumb, she fixed her eyes on a
      flower which was hanging from a vase. This red flower fascinated her. She
      could not take her eyes off it. Within her a persistent thought recurred:
      that of her irremediable misfortune. Madame Desvarennes looked at her for
      a moment; then, gently touching her shoulder, resumed;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you answer me? Have you not confidence in me? Have I not brought
      you up? And if you are not born of me, have not the tenderness and care I
      have lavished upon you made me your real mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne did not answer, but her eyes filled with tears;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that I love you,&rdquo; continued the mistress. &ldquo;Come, come to my arms
      as you used to do when you were little and were suffering. Place your head
      thereon my heart and let your tears flow. I see they are choking you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne could no longer resist, and falling on her knees beside Madame
      Desvarennes, she buried her face in the silky and scented folds of her
      dress like a frightened bird that flies to the nest and hides itself under
      the wings of its mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      This great and hopeless grief was to the mistress a certain proof that
      Cayrol was right. Jeanne had loved and still loved another man than her
      husband. But why had she not said anything, and why had she allowed
      herself to be married to the banker? She had resisted, she remembered now.
      She had struggled, and the refusals they had put down to pride they must
      now attribute to passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not wish to be separated from him whom she loved. Hence the
      struggle that had ended in her abandoning her hand to Cayrol, perhaps in a
      moment of despair and discouragement. But why had he whom she loved not
      married her? What obstacle had arisen between him and the young girl?
      Jeanne, so beautiful, and dowered by Madame Desvarennes, who then could
      have hesitated to ask her hand?
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he whom Jeanne loved was unworthy of her? No! She would not have
      chosen him. Perhaps he was not free to marry? Yes, it must be that. Some
      married man, perhaps! A scoundrel who did not mind breaking a young girl&rsquo;s
      heart! Where had she met him? In society at her house in the Rue
      Saint-Dominique, perhaps! Who could tell? He very likely still continued
      to come there. At the thought Madame Desvarennes grew angry. She wished to
      know the name of the man so that she might have an explanation with him,
      and tell him what she thought of his base conduct. The gentleman should
      have respectable, well-educated girls to trifle with, should he? And he
      risked nothing! He should be shown to the door with all honors due to his
      shameful conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne was still weeping silently at Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s knee. The latter
      raised her head gently and wiped away the tears with her lace
      pocket-handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my child! all this deluge means nothing. You must make up your
      mind. I can understand your hiding anything from your husband, but not
      from me! What is your lover&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This question so simply put, threw a faint light on Jeanne&rsquo;s troubled
      brain. She saw the danger she was running. To speak before Madame
      Desvarennes! To tell the name of him who had been false to her! To her!
      Was it possible? In a moment she understood that she was about to destroy
      Micheline and Serge. Her conscience revolted and she would not. She raised
      herself and looking at Madame Desvarennes with still frightened eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For pity&rsquo;s sake, forget my tears! Don&rsquo;t believe what my husband has told
      you. Never seek to know. Remain ignorant as you are on the subject!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he whom you love is related to me, as: you wish to hide his name
      even from me,&rdquo; said Madame Desvarennes with instinctive anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent. Her eyes became fixed. They looked without seeing. She was
      thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beseech you,&rdquo; cried Jeanne, madly placing her hands before Madame
      Desvarennes&rsquo;s face as if to check her scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had a son,&rdquo; continued the mistress, &ldquo;I would believe&mdash;&rdquo;
       Suddenly she ceased speaking; she became pale, and bending toward Jeanne,
      she looked into her very soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it&mdash;&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; interrupted Jeanne, terrified at seeing that the mistress had
      found out the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You deny it before I have pronounced the name?&rdquo; said Madame Desvarennes
      in a loud voice. &ldquo;You read it then on my lips? Unhappy girl! The man whom
      you love is the husband of my daughter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My daughter! The accent with which Madame Desvarennes pronounced the word
      &ldquo;my&rdquo; was full of tragical power. It revealed the mother capable of doing
      anything to defend the happiness of the child whom she adored. Serge had
      calculated well. Between Jeanne and Micheline, Madame Desvarennes would
      not hesitate. She would have allowed the world to crumble away to make of
      its ruins a shelter where her daughter would be joyous and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne had fallen back overwhelmed. The mistress raised her roughly. She
      had no more consideration for her. It was necessary that she should speak.
      Jeanne was the sole witness, and if the truth had to be got by main force
      she should be made to speak it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, forgive me!&rdquo; moaned the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a question of that! In one word, answer me: Does he love you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he tell you he did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he has married Micheline!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame Desvarennes, with a
      fearful gesture. &ldquo;I distrusted him. Why did I not obey my instinct?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she began walking about like a lioness in a cage. Then, suddenly
      stopping and placing herself before Jeanne, she continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must help me to save Micheline!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thought only of her own flesh and blood. Without hesitation,
      unconsciously, she abandoned the other&mdash;the child of adoption. She
      claimed the safety of her daughter as a debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has she to fear?&rdquo; asked Jeanne, bitterly. &ldquo;She triumphs, as she is
      his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he were to abandon her,&rdquo; said the mother with anguish. Then,
      reflecting: &ldquo;Still, he has sworn to me that he loved her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lied!&rdquo; cried Jeanne, with rage. &ldquo;He wanted Micheline for her fortune!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why that?&rdquo; inquired Madame Desvarennes, menacingly. &ldquo;Is she not
      pretty enough to have pleased him? Do you think that you are the only one
      to be loved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had been rich he would have married me!&rdquo;, replied Jeanne,
      exasperated.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had risen in revolt. They were treading too heavily on her. With a
      ferocious cry of triumph; she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The night he used his influence with me to get me to marry Cayrol, he
      assured me so on his word of honor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honor!&rdquo; ironically repeated Madame Desvarennes, overwhelmed. &ldquo;How he has
      deceived us all! But what can I do? What course can I take? A separation?
      Micheline would not consent. She loves him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, in an outburst of fury, she cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible that that stupid girl loves that worthless dandy? And she
      has my blood in her veins! If she knew the truth she would die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I dead?&rdquo; asked Jeanne, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have an energetic nature,&rdquo; retorted the mistress, compassionately;
      &ldquo;but she is so weak, so gentle! Ah! Jeanne, think what I have been to you;
      raise some insurmountable barrier between yourself and Serge!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back to your husband. You would not go with him a little while ago. It
      was folly. If you separate from Cayrol, you will not be able to keep away
      Serge, and you will take my daughter&rsquo;s husband from her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you think only of her! Her, always! She above all!&rdquo; cried Jeanne,
      with rage. &ldquo;But me, I exist, I count, I have the right to be protected, of
      being happy! And you wish me to sacrifice myself, to give myself up to
      this man, whom I do not love, and who terrifies me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time the question was plainly put. Madame Desvarennes became herself.
      She straightened her figure, and in her commanding voice whose authority
      no one resisted, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then? You wish to be separated from him? To regain your liberty at
      the price of scandal? And what liberty? You will be repulsed, disdained.
      Believe me, impose silence on your heart and listen to your reason. Your
      husband is a good, loyal man. If you cannot love him, he will command your
      respect. In marrying him, you have entered into engagements toward him.
      Fulfil them; it is your duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne felt overpowered and vanquished. &ldquo;But what will my life be?&rdquo; she
      groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That of an honest woman,&rdquo; replied Madame Desvarennes, with true grandeur.
      &ldquo;Be a wife; God will make you a mother, and you will be saved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne bowed herself at these words. She no longer felt in them the
      selfishness of the mother. What the mistress now said was sincere and
      true. It was no longer her agitated and alarmed heart that inspired her;
      it was her conscience, calm and sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; I will obey you,&rdquo; said the young wife, simply. &ldquo;Kiss me then,
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bent her brow, and Madame Desvarennes let tears of gratitude and
      admiration fall on it. Then Jeanne went of her own accord to the room
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Monsieur,&rdquo; called she to Cayrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband, grown cooler while waiting, and troubled at the length of the
      interview, showed his anxious face on the threshold. He saw Madame
      Desvarennes grave, and Jeanne collected. He dared not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cayrol, everything is explained,&rdquo; said the mistress. &ldquo;You have nothing to
      fear from him whom you suspected. He is separated from Jeanne forever,
      And; besides, nothing has passed between him and her who is your wife that
      could arouse your jealousy. I will not tell you the name of this man now.
      But if perchance he by some impossibility reappeared and threatened your
      happiness, I would myself&mdash;you understand, me?&mdash;point him out to
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol remained thinking for, a moment; then addressing Madame
      Desvarennes, replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well. I have confidence in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then turning toward Jeanne, he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me and let everything be forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mistress&rsquo;s face beamed with joy, as she followed their departing
      figures with her eyes, and murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brave hearts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, changing her expression:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for the other one!&rdquo; exclaimed she.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she went out on to the terrace.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. THE FETE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The air was mild, the night clear and bright. Cayrol&rsquo;s carriage rolled
      rapidly along the broad avenue of the park shadowed by tall trees, the
      lanterns throwing, as they passed, their quivering light on the thickets.
      The rumbling carriages took the last guests to the railway station. It was
      past midnight. A nightingale began singing his song of love to the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes mechanically stopped to listen. A sense of sorrow came
      over this mother who was a prey to the most cruel mental anguish. She
      thought that she could have been very happy on that splendid night, if her
      heart had been full of quietude and serenity. Her two daughters were
      married; her last task was accomplished. She ought to have nothing to do
      but enjoy life after her own fashioning, and be calm and satisfied.
      Instead of that, here were fear and dissimulation taking possession of her
      mind; and an ardent, pitiless struggle beginning against the man who had
      deceived her daughter and lied to her. The bark which carried her fortune,
      on reaching port, had caught fire, and it was necessary to begin laboring
      again amid cares and pains.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dull rage filled her heart. To have so surely built up the edifice of
      her happiness, to have embellished it every hour, and then to see an
      intruder audaciously taking possession of it, and making his despotic and
      hateful authority prevail! And what could she do against this new master?
      Nothing. He was marvellously protected by Micheline&rsquo;s mad love for him. To
      strike Serge would be to wound Micheline, surely and mortally. So this
      scoundrel could laugh at her and dare her with impunity!
    </p>
    <p>
      What must she do? Take him aside and tell him that she knew of his
      disloyal conduct, and tell him of her contempt and hatred for him? And
      after that? What would be the consequence of this outburst of violence?
      The Prince, using his power over Micheline, would separate the daughter
      from the mother. And Madame Desvarennes would be alone in her corner,
      abandoned like a poor dog, and would die of despair and anger. What other
      course then? She must dissemble, mask her face with indifference, if
      possible with tenderness, and undertake the difficult task of separating
      Micheline from the man whom she adored. It was quite a feat of strategy to
      plan. To bring out the husband&rsquo;s faults and to make his errors known, and
      give her the opportunity of proving his worthlessness. In a word, to make
      the young wife understand that she had married an elegant manikin,
      unworthy of her love.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be an easy matter to lay snares for Serge. He was a gambler. She
      could let him have ready money to satisfy his passion. Once in the
      clutches of the demon of play, he would neglect his wife, and the mother
      might regain a portion of the ground she had lost. Micheline&rsquo;s fortune
      once broken into, she would interpose between her daughter and son-in-law.
      She would make him pull up, and holding him tightly by her purse strings,
      would lead him whither she liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already in fancy she saw her authority regained, and her daughter, her
      treasure, her life, true mistress of the situation, grateful to her for
      having saved her. And then, she thought, a baby will come, and if
      Micheline is really my daughter, she will adore the little thing, and the
      blind love which she has given to her husband will be diminished by so
      much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge did not know what an adversary he had against him in his
      mother-in-law. It was a bad thing to cross the mistress when business
      matters were concerned, but now that her daughter&rsquo;s happiness was at
      stake! A smile came to her lips. A firm resolution from that hour must
      guide her, and the struggle between her son-in-law and herself could only
      end by the crushing of one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the distance the music from the work-people&rsquo;s ball was heard. Madame
      Desvarennes mechanically bent her steps toward the tent under which the
      heavy bounds of the dancers reechoed. Every now and then large shadows
      appeared on the canvas. A joyful clamor issued from the ballroom. Loud
      laughter resounded, mingled with piercing cries of tickled women.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of the master of the ceremonies could be heard jocose and
      solemn: &ldquo;La poule! Advance! Set to partners!&rdquo; Then the stamping of heavy
      shoes on the badly planed floor, and, above all, the melancholy sounds of
      the clarionet and the shrill notes of the cornet were audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the entrance of the ballroom, surrounded by tables and stools, two
      barrels of wine on stands presented their wooden taps, ready for those who
      wanted to quench their thirst. A large red mark under each barrel showed
      that the hands of the drinkers wire no longer steady. A cake-seller had
      taken up his place at the other side, and was kneading a last batch of
      paste, while his apprentice was ringing a bell which hung over the iron
      cooking-stove to attract customers. There was an odor of rancid butter,
      spilled wine, and paraffin oil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adjoining the ballroom, a merry-go-round; which had been the delight of
      the village urchins all day, appealed for custom by the aid of a
      barrel-organ on which a woman in a white bodice was playing the waltz from
      &lsquo;Les Cloches de Corneville&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The animation of this fete, in the midst of which Madame Desvarennes
      suddenly appeared, was a happy diversion from the serious thoughts which
      beset her. She remembered that Serge and Micheline must be there. She came
      from under the shadow of the avenue into the full light. On recognizing
      her, all the workpeople, who were seated, rose. She was really mistress
      and lady of the place. And then she had fed these people since morning.
      With a sign she bade them be seated, and walking quickly toward the
      dancing-room, lifted the red and white cotton curtain which hung over the
      entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, in a space of a hundred square yards or so, about a hundred and
      fifty people were sitting or standing. At the end, on a stage, were the
      musicians, each with a bottle of wine at his feet, from which they
      refreshed themselves during the intervals. An impalpable dust, raised by
      the feet of the dancers, filled the air charged with acrid odors. The
      women in light dresses and bareheaded, and the men arrayed in their Sunday
      clothes, gave themselves up with frantic ardor to their favorite pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ranged in double rows, vis-a-vis, they were waiting with impatience for
      the music to strike up for the last figure. Near the orchestra, Serge was
      dancing with the Mayor&rsquo;s daughter opposite Micheline, whose partner was
      the mayor himself. An air of joyful gravity lit up the municipal officer&rsquo;s
      face. He was enjoying the honor which the Princess had done him. His
      pretty young daughter, dressed, in her confirmation dress, which had been
      lengthened with a muslin flounce, a rose in her hair, and her hands
      encased in straw-colored one-button kid gloves, hardly dared raise her
      eyes to the Prince, and with burning cheeks, answered in monosyllables the
      few remarks Serge felt forced to address to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orchestra bellowed, the floor shook; the two lines of dancers had
      advanced in a body. Madame Desvarennes, leaning against the door-post,
      followed with her eyes her daughter, whose light footsteps contrasted
      strangely with the heavy tread of the women around her. The mayor, eager
      and respectful, followed her, making efforts to keep up with her without
      treading on her long train. It was,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Madame la Princesse. If Madame la Princesse will do me the
      honor to give me her hand, it is our turn to cross.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had just crossed. Serge suddenly found himself facing his
      mother-in-law. His face lit up, and he uttered a joyful exclamation.
      Micheline raised her eyes, and following her husband&rsquo;s look, perceived her
      mother. Then it was a double joy. With a mischievous wink, Serge called
      Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s attention to the mayor&rsquo;s solemn appearance as he was
      galloping with Micheline, also the comical positions of the rustics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Micheline was smiling. She was enjoying herself. All this homely gayety,
      of which she was the cause, made her feel happy. She enjoyed the pleasure
      of those around her. With her compassionate eyes she thanked her mother in
      the distance for having prepared this fete in honor of her marriage. The
      clarionet, violin, and cornet sounded a last modulation, then the final
      cadence put an end to the bounds of the dances. Each took his lady to her
      place&mdash;the mayor with pompous gait, Serge with as much grace as if he
      had been at an ambassador&rsquo;s ball and was leading a young lady of highest
      rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes was suddenly surrounded; cheers resounded, the band
      struck up the Marseillaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us escape,&rdquo; said Serge, &ldquo;because these good people will think nothing
      of carrying us in triumph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And leading away his mother-in-law and his wife, he left the ballroom
      followed by cheers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside they all three walked in silence. The night air was delightful
      after coming out of that furnace. The cheering had ceased, and the
      orchestra was playing a polka. Micheline had taken her husband&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went along slowly, and close together. Not a word was exchanged; they
      all three seemed to be listening within themselves. When they reached the
      house, they went up the steps leading into the greenhouse, which served
      also as a boudoir to Madame Desvarennes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The atmosphere was still warm and scented, the lamps still burning. The
      guests had left; Micheline looked round. The remembrance of this happy
      evening, which had been the crowning of her happiness, filled her heart
      with emotion. Turning toward her mother with a radiant face, she cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! mamma! I am so happy,&rdquo; and threw her arms around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge started at this cry. Two tears came to his eyes, and looking a
      little pale, he stretched out to Madame Desvarennes his hands, which she
      felt trembling in hers, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes gazed at him for a moment. She did not see the shadow
      of a wicked thought on his brow. He was sincerely affected, truly
      grateful. The idea occurred to her that Jeanne had deceived her, or had
      deceived herself, and that Serge had not loved her. A feeling of relief
      took possession of her. But distrust had unfortunately entered her mind.
      She put away that flattering hope. And giving her son-in-law such a look,
      which, had he been less moved, he would have understood, she murmured,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIII. THE FIRST BREAK
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first two months of this union were truly enchanting. Serge and
      Micheline never left each other. After an absence of eight days they had
      returned to Paris with Madame Desvarennes, and the hitherto dull mansion
      in the Rue Saint-Dominique was filled with joyful bustle. The splendid
      stables, formerly too large for the mistress&rsquo;s three horses, were now
      insufficient for the service of the Prince. There were eight splendid
      carriage-horses, a pair of charming ponies&mdash;bought especially for
      Micheline&rsquo;s use, but which the young wife had not been able to make up her
      mind to drive herself&mdash;four saddle-horses, upon which every morning
      about eight o&rsquo;clock, when the freshness of night had perfumed the Bois de
      Boulogne, the young people took their ride round the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bright sun made the sheet of water sparkle between its borders of dark
      fir-trees; the fresh air played in Micheline&rsquo;s veil, and the tawny leather
      of the saddles creaked. Those were happy days for Micheline, who was
      delighted at having Serge near her, attentive to her every want, and
      controlling his thoroughbred English horse to her gentle pace. Every now
      and then his mount would wheel about and rear in revolt, she following him
      with fond looks, proud of the elegant cavalier who could subdue without
      apparent effort, by the mere pressure of his thighs, that impetuous steed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she would give her horse a touch with the whip, and off she would go
      at a gallop, feeling happy with the wind blowing in her face, and he whom
      she loved by her side to smile on and encourage her. Then they would
      scamper along; the dog with his thin body almost touching the ground,
      racing and frightening the rabbits, which shot across the road swift as
      bullets. Out of breath by the violent ride, Micheline would stop, and pat
      the neck of her lovely chestnut horse. Slowly the young people would
      return to the Rue Saint-Dominique, and, on arriving in the courtyard,
      there was such a pawing of feet as brought the clerks to the windows,
      hiding behind the curtains. Tired with healthy exercise, Micheline would
      go smiling to the office where her mother was hard at work, and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are, mamma!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mistress would rise and kiss her daughter beaming with freshness. Then
      they would go up to breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s doubts were lulled to rest. She saw her daughter
      happy. Her son-in-law was in every respect cordial and charming toward
      her. Cayrol and his wife had scarcely been in Paris since their marriage.
      The banker had joined Herzog in his great scheme of the &ldquo;Credit,&rdquo; and was
      travelling all over Europe establishing offices and securing openings.
      Jeanne accompanied him. They were then in Greece. The young wife&rsquo;s letters
      to her adopted mother breathed calmness and satisfaction. She highly
      praised her husband&rsquo;s kindness to her, and said it was unequalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      No allusion was made to that evening of their marriage, when, escaping
      from Cayrol&rsquo;s wrath, she had thrown herself in Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s arms,
      and had allowed her secret to be found out. The mistress might well think
      then that the thought which at times still troubled her mind was a
      remembrance of a bad dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      What contributed especially to make her feel secure was Jeanne&rsquo;s absence.
      If the young woman had been near Serge, Madame Desvarennes might have
      trembled. But Micheline&rsquo;s beautiful rival was far away, and Serge seemed
      very much in love with his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything was for the best. The formidable projects which Madame
      Desvarennes had formed in the heat of her passion had not been carried out.
      Serge had as yet not given Madame Desvarennes cause for real displeasure.
      Certainly he was spending money foolishly, but then his wife was so rich!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had put his household on an extraordinary footing. Everything that most
      refined luxury had invented he had introduced as a matter of course, and
      for everyday use. He entertained magnificently several times a week. And
      Madame Desvarennes, from her apartments, for she would never appear at
      these grand receptions, heard the noise of these doings. This woman,
      modest and simple in her ideas, whose luxury had always been artistic,
      wondered that they could spend so much on frivolous entertainments. But
      Micheline was queen of these sumptuous ceremonies. She came in full dress
      to be admired by her mother, before going down to receive her guests, and
      the mistress had not courage to offer any remonstrances as to expense when
      she saw her daughter so brilliant and contented.
    </p>
    <p>
      They played cards very much. The great colony of foreigners who came every
      week to Panine&rsquo;s receptions brought with them their immoderate passion for
      cards, and he was only too willing to give way to it. These gentlemen,
      among them all, almost without taking off their white kid gloves, would
      win or lose between forty and fifty thousand francs at bouillotte, just to
      give them an appetite before going to the club to finish the night at
      baccarat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the ladies, with their graceful toilettes displayed on the low
      soft chairs, talked of dress behind their fans, or listened to the songs
      of a professional singer, while young men whispered soft nothings in their
      ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was rumored that the Prince lost heavily. It was not to be wondered at;
      he was so happy in love! Madame Desvarennes, who used every means of
      gaining information on the subject, even to the gossip of the servants,
      heard that the sums were enormous. No doubt they were exaggerated, but the
      fact remained the same. The Prince was losing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes could not resist the inclination of finding out whether
      Micheline knew what was going on, and one morning when the young wife came
      down to see her mother, dressed in a lovely pink gown, the mistress, while
      teasing her daughter, said, carelessly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems your husband lost heavily last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Micheline looked astonished at Madame Desvarennes, and in a quiet voice
      replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good host may not win from his guests; it would look as if he invited
      them to rob them. Losses at cards are included in the costs of a
      reception.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes thought that her daughter had become a very grand lady,
      and had soon acquired expanded ideas. But she dared not say anything more.
      She dreaded a quarrel with her daughter, and would have sacrificed
      everything to retain her cajoling ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw herself into her work with renewed vigor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the Prince spends large sums,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;I will earn
      larger ones. There can be no hole dug deep enough by him that I shall not
      be able, to fill up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she made the money come in at the door so that her son-in-law might
      throw it out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fine day these great people who visited at the mansion in the Rue
      Saint-Dominique hastened away to the country. September had arrived,
      bringing with it the shooting season. The Prince and Micheline settled
      themselves at Cernay, not as in the first days of their marriage as lovers
      who sought quietude, but as people sure of their happiness, who wished to
      make a great show. They took all the carriages with them, and there was
      nothing but bustle and movement. The four keepers, dressed in the Prince&rsquo;s
      livery, came daily for orders as to shooting arrangements. And every week
      shoals of visitors arrived, brought from the station in large breaks drawn
      by four horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princely dwelling was in its full splendor. There was a continual
      going and coming of fashionable worldlings. From top to bottom of the
      castle was a constant rustling of silk dresses; groups of pretty women,
      coming downstairs with peals of merry laughter and singing snatches from
      the last opera. In the spacious hall they played billiards and other
      games, while one of the gentlemen performed on the large organ. There was
      a strange mixture of freedom and strictness. The smoke of Russian
      cigarettes mingled with the scent of opoponax. An elegant confusion which
      ended about six o&rsquo;clock in a general flight, when the sportsmen came home,
      and the guests went to their rooms. An hour afterward all these people met
      in the large drawing-room; the ladies in low-bodied evening dresses; the
      gentlemen in dress-coats and white satin waistcoats, with a sprig of
      mignonette and a white rose in their buttonholes. After dinner, they
      danced in the drawing-rooms, where a mad waltz would even restore energy
      to the gentlemen tired out by six hours spent in the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes did not join in that wild existence. She had remained
      in Paris, attentive to business. On Saturdays she came down by the five
      o&rsquo;clock train and regularly returned on the Monday morning. Her presence
      checked their wild gayety a little. Her black dress was like a blot among
      the brocades and satins. Her severe gravity, that of a woman who pays and
      sees the money going too fast, was like a reproach, silent but explicit,
      to that gay and thoughtless throng of idlers, solely taken up by their
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servants made fun of her. One day the Prince&rsquo;s valet, who thought
      himself a clever fellow, said before all the other servants that Mother
      Damper had arrived. Of course they all roared with laughter and exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bother the old woman! Why does she come and worry us? She had far better
      stop in the office and earn money; that&rsquo;s all she&rsquo;s good for!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The disdain which the servants learned from their master grew rapidly. So
      much so that one Monday morning, toward nine o&rsquo;clock, Madame Desvarennes
      came down to the courtyard, expecting to find the carriage which generally
      took her to the station. It was the second coachman&rsquo;s duty to drive her,
      and she did not see him. Thinking that he was a little late, she walked to
      the stable-yard. There, instead of the victoria which usually took her,
      she saw a large mail-coach to which two grooms were harnessing the
      Prince&rsquo;s four bays. The head coachman, an Englishman, dressed like a
      gentleman, with a stand-up collar, and a rose in his buttonhole, stood
      watching the operations with an air of importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes went straight to him. He had seen her coming, out of
      the corner of his eye, without disturbing himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it that the carriage is not ready to take me to the station?&rdquo;
       asked the mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Madame,&rdquo; answered this personage, condescendingly, without
      taking his hat off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where is the coachman who generally drives me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. If Madame would like to see in the stables&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with a careless gesture, the Englishman pointed out to Madame
      Desvarennes the magnificent buildings at the end of the courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood rose to the mistress&rsquo;s cheeks; she gave the coachman such a look
      that he moved away a little. Then glancing at her watch, she said, coldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only a quarter of an hour before the train leaves, but here are
      horses that ought to go well. Jump on the box, my man, you shall drive
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those horses are not for service; they are only for pleasure,&rdquo; he
      answered. &ldquo;I drive the Prince. I don&rsquo;t mind driving the Princess, but I am
      not here to drive you, Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with an insolent gesture, setting his hat firmly on his head, he
      turned his back upon the mistress. At the same moment, a sharp stroke from
      a light cane made his hat roll on the pavement. And as the Englishman
      turned round, red with rage, he found himself face to face with the
      Prince, whose approach neither Madame Desvarennes nor he had heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge, in an elegant morning suit, was going round his stables when he had
      been attracted by this discussion. The Englishman, uneasy, sought to frame
      an excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue!&rdquo; exclaimed the Prince, sharply, &ldquo;and go and wait my
      orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And turning toward the mistress:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since this man refuses to drive you, I shall have the pleasure of taking
      you to the station myself,&rdquo; he said, with a charming smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as Madame Desvarennes remonstrated,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I can drive four-in-hand,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;For once in my life that talent
      will have been of some use to me. Pray jump in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And opening the door of the mail-coach he handed her into the vast
      carriage. Then, climbing with one bound to the box, he gathered the reins
      and, cigar in mouth, with all the coolness of an old coachman, he started
      the horses in the presence of all the grooms, and made a perfect
      semicircle on the gravel of the courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incident was repeated favorably for Serge. It was agreed that he had
      behaved like a true nobleman. Micheline was proud of it, and saw in this
      act of deference to her mother a proof of his love for her. As to the
      mistress, she understood the advantage this clever manoeuvre gave to the
      Prince. At the same time she felt the great distance which henceforth
      separated her from the world in which her daughter lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The insolence of that servant was a revelation to her. They despised her.
      The Prince&rsquo;s coachman would not condescend to drive a plebeian like her.
      She paid the wages of these servants to no purpose. Her plebeian origin
      and business habits were a vice. They submitted to her; they did not
      respect her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although her son-in-law and daughter were perfect toward her in their
      behavior, she became gloomy and dull, and but seldom went now to Cernay.
      She felt in the way, and uncomfortable. The smiling and superficial
      politeness of the visitors irritated her nerves. These people were too
      well bred to be rude toward Panine&rsquo;s mother-in-law, but she felt that
      their politeness was forced. Under their affected nicety she detected
      irony. She began to hate them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge, sovereign lord of Cernay, was really happy. Every moment he
      experienced new pleasure in gratifying his taste for luxury. His love for
      horses grew more and more. He gave orders to have a model stud-house
      erected in the park amid the splendid meadows watered by the Oise; and
      bought stallions and breeding mares from celebrated English breeders. He
      contemplated starting a racing stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day when Madame Desvarennes arrived at Cernay, she was surprised to
      see the greensward bordering the woods marked out with white stakes. She
      asked inquiringly what these stakes meant? Micheline answered in an easy
      tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you saw them? That is the track for training. We made Mademoiselle de
      Cernay gallop there to-day. She&rsquo;s a level-going filly with which Serge
      hopes to win the next Poule des Produits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mistress was amazed. A child who had been brought up so simply, in
      spite of her large fortune, a little commoner, speaking of level-going
      fillies and the Poule des Produits! What a change had come over her and
      what incredible influence this frivolous, vain Panine had over that young
      and right-minded girl! And that in a few months! What would it be later?
      He would succeed in imparting to her his tastes and would mould her to his
      whims, and the young modest girl whom he had received from the mother
      would become a horsey and fast woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it possible that Micheline could be happy in that hollow and empty
      life? The love of her husband satisfied her. His love was all she asked
      for, all else was indifferent to her. Thus of her mother, the impassioned
      toiler, was born the passionate lover! All the fervency which the mother
      had given to business, Micheline had given to love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, Serge behaved irreproachably. One must do him that justice. Not
      even an appearance accused him. He was faithful, unlikely as that may seem
      in a man of his kind; he never left his wife. He had hardly ever gone out
      without her; they were a couple of turtle-doves. They were laughed at.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Princess has tied a string round Serge&rsquo;s foot,&rdquo; was said by some of
      Serge&rsquo;s former woman friends!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was something to be sure of her daughter&rsquo;s happiness. That happiness
      was dearly, bought; but as the proverb says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money troubles are not mortal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, besides, it was evident that the Prince did not keep account of his
      money; his hand was always open. And never did a great lord do more honor
      to his fortune. Panine, in marrying Micheline, had found the mistress&rsquo;s
      cash-box at his disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      This prodigious cash-box had seemed to him inexhaustible, and he had drawn
      on it like a Prince in the Arabian Nights on the treasure of the genii.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it would suffice to let him see that he was spending the capital
      as well as the income to make him alter his line of conduct. At all
      events, the moment was not yet opportune, and, besides, the amount was not
      yet large enough. Cry out about some hundred thousand francs! Madame
      Desvarennes would be thought a miser and would be covered with shame. She
      must wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, shut up in her office in the Rue Saint-Dominique with Marechal, who
      acted as her confidant, she worked with heart and soul full of passion and
      anger, making money. It was fine to witness the duel between these two
      beings: the one useful, the other useless; one sacrificing everything to
      work, the other everything to pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the end of October, the weather at Cernay became unsettled, and
      Micheline complained of the cold. Country life so pleased Serge that he
      turned a deaf ear to her complaints. But lost in that large house, the
      autumn winds rustling through the trees, whose leaves were tinted with
      yellow, Micheline became sad, and the Prince understood that it was time
      to go back to Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town seemed deserted to Serge. Still, returning to his splendid
      apartments was a great satisfaction and pleasure to him. Everything
      appeared new. He reviewed the hangings, the expensive furniture, the
      paintings and rare objects. He was charmed. It was really of wonderful
      beauty, and the cage seemed worthy of the bird. For several evenings he
      remained quietly at home with Micheline, in the little silver-gray
      drawing-room that was his favorite room. He looked through albums, too,
      while his wife played at her piano quietly or sang.
    </p>
    <p>
      They retired early and came down late. Then he had become a gourmand. He
      spent hours in arranging menus and inventing unknown dishes about which he
      consulted his chef, a cook of note.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rode in the Bois in the course of the day, but did not meet any one
      there; for of every two carriages one was a hackney coach with a worn-out
      sleepy horse, his head hanging between his knees, going the round of the
      lake. He ceased going to the Bois, and went out on foot in the
      Champs-Elysees. He crossed the Pont de la Concorde, and walked up and down
      the avenues near the Cirque.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was wearied. Life had never appeared so monotonous to him. Formerly he
      had at least the preoccupations of the future. He asked himself how he
      could alter the sad condition in which he vegetated! Shut up in this happy
      existence, without a care or a cross, he grew weary like a prisoner in his
      cell. He longed for the unforeseen; his wife irritated him, she was of too
      equable a temperament. She always met him with the same smile on her lips.
      And then happiness agreed with her too well; she was growing stout.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, on the Boulevard des Italiens, Serge met an old friend, the Baron
      de Prefont, a hardened &lsquo;roue&rsquo;. He had not seen him since his marriage. It
      was a pleasure to him. They had a thousand things to say to each other.
      And walking along, they came to the Rue Royale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to the club,&rdquo; said Prefont, taking Serge by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince, having nothing else to do, allowed himself to be led away, and
      went. He felt a strange pleasure in those large rooms of the club, the
      Grand Cercle, with their glaring furniture. The common easy-chairs,
      covered with dark leather, seemed delightful. He did not notice the
      well-worn carpets burned here and there by the hot cigar-ash; the strong
      smell of tobacco, impregnated in the curtains, did not make him feel
      qualmish. He was away from home, and was satisfied with anything for a
      change. He had been domesticated long enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, taking up the newspaper, a name caught Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s
      eye-that of the Prince. She read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The golden book of the Grand Cercle has just had another illustrious name
      inscribed in it. The Prince Panine was admitted yesterday, proposed by the
      Baron de Prefont and the Duc de Bligny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These few lines made Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s blood boil. Her ears tingled as
      if all the bells of Saint-Etienne-du-Mont had been rung together. In a
      rapid vision, she saw misfortune coming. Her son-in-law, that born
      gambler, at the Grand Cercle! No more smiles for Micheline; henceforth she
      had a terrible rival&mdash;the devouring love of play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Madame Desvarennes reflected. The husband&rsquo;s deserting his fireside
      would be salvation for herself. The door by which he went out, would serve
      as an entrance for her. The plan which she had conceived at Cernay that
      terrible night of the marriage when Jeanne had confided in her, remained
      for her to execute. By opening her purse widely to the Prince, she would
      help him in his vice. And she would infallibly succeed in separating Serge
      and Micheline.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the mistress checked herself. Lend her hands to the destruction of her
      son-in-law in a fit of fierce maternal egoism? Was it not unworthy of her?
      How many tears would the Prince&rsquo;s errors cost her whom she wished to
      regain at all price? And then would she always be there to compensate by
      her devoted affection the bitterly regretted estrangement from the
      husband? She would, in dying, leave the household disunited.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was horrified at what she had for an instant dreamed of doing. And
      instead of helping the Prince on to destruction, she determined to do all
      in her power to keep him in the path of honor. That resolution formed,
      Madame Desvarennes was satisfied. She felt superior to Serge, and to a
      mind like hers the thought was strengthening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The admission to the Grand Cercle gave Serge a powerful element of
      interest in life: He had to manoeuvre to obtain his liberty. His first
      evenings spent from home troubled Micheline deeply. The young wife was
      jealous when she saw her husband going out. She feared a rival, and
      trembled for her love. Serge&rsquo;s mysterious conduct caused her intolerable
      torture. She dared not say anything to her mother, and remained perfectly
      quiet on the subject before her husband. She sought discreetly, listened
      to the least word that might throw any light on the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day she found an ivory counter, bearing the stamp of the Grand Cercle,
      in her husband&rsquo;s dressing-room. It was in the Rue Royale then that her
      husband spent his evenings. This discovery was a great relief to her. It
      was not very wrong to go there, and if the Prince did go and smoke a few
      cigars and have a game at bouillotte, it was not a very great crime. The
      return of his usual friends to Paris and the resumption of their
      receptions would bring him home again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge now left Micheline about ten o&rsquo;clock in the evening regularly and
      arrived at the club about eleven. High play did not commence until after
      midnight. Then he seated himself at the gaming-table with all the ardor of
      a professional gambler. His face changed its expression. When winning, it
      was animated with an expression of awful joy; when losing, he looked as
      hard as a stone, his features contracted, and his eyes were full of gloomy
      fire. He bit his mustache convulsively. Moreover, always silent, winning
      or losing with superb indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lost. His bad luck had followed him. At the club his losses were no
      longer limited. There was always some one willing to take a hand, and
      until dawn he played, wasting his life and energies to satisfy his insane
      love of gambling.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, Marechal entered Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s private office, holding
      a little square piece of paper. Without speaking a word, he placed it on
      the desk. The mistress took it, read what was written upon it in shaky
      handwriting, and suddenly becoming purple, rose. The paper bore these
      simple words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Received from Monsieur Salignon the sum of one hundred thousand francs.
      Serge Panine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who brought this paper?&rdquo; asked Madame Desvarennes, crushing it between
      her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The waiter who attends the card-room at the club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The waiter?&rdquo; cried Madame Desvarennes, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he is a sort of banker,&rdquo; said Marechal. &ldquo;These gentlemen apply to him
      when they run short of money. The Prince must have found himself in that
      predicament. Still he has just received the rents for the property in the
      Rue de Rivoli.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rents!&rdquo; grumbled Madame Desvarennes, with an energetic movement. &ldquo;The
      rents! A drop of water in a river! You don&rsquo;t know that he is a man to lose
      the hundred thousand francs which they claim, in one night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mistress paced up and down the room. She suddenly came to a
      standstill. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t stop him, the rogue will sell the feather-bed from
      under my daughter! But he shall have a little of my mind! He has provoked
      me long enough. Pay it! I&rsquo;ll take my money&rsquo;s worth out of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in a second, Madame Desvarennes was in the Prince&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge, after a delicate breakfast, was smoking and dozing on the
      smoking-room sofa. The night had been a heavy one for him. He had won two
      hundred and fifty thousand francs from Ibrahim Bey, then he had lost all,
      besides five thousand louis advanced by the obliging Salignon. He had told
      the waiter to come to the Rue Saint-Dominique, and by mistake the man had
      gone to the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sudden opening of the smoking-room door roused Serge. He unclosed his
      eyes and looked very much astonished at seeing Madame Desvarennes appear.
      Pale, frowning, and holding the accusing paper in her hand, she angrily
      inquired:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you recognize that?&rdquo; and placed the receipt which he had signed,
      before him, as he slowly rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge seized it quickly, and then looking coldly at his mother-in-law,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did this paper come into your hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has just been brought to my cashier. A hundred thousand francs! Faith!
      You are going ahead! Do you know how many bushels of corn must be ground
      to earn that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Madame,&rdquo; said the Prince, interrupting Madame
      Desvarennes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you came here to give me a lesson in
      commercial statistics. This paper was presented to your cashier by
      mistake. I was expecting it, and here is the money ready to pay it. As you
      have been good enough to do so, pray refund yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And taking a bundle of bank-notes from a cabinet, the Prince handed them
      to the astonished mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she sought to say, very much put out by this unexpected answer,
      &ldquo;where did you get this money from? You must have inconvenienced
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the Prince, quietly, &ldquo;that only concerns myself.
      Be good enough to see whether the amount is there,&rdquo; added he with a smile.
      &ldquo;I reckon so badly that it is possible I may have made a mistake to your
      disadvantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes pushed away the hand which presented the bank-notes,
      and shook her head gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep this money,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;unfortunately you will need it. You have
      entered on a very dangerous path, which grieves me very much. I would
      willingly give ten times the amount, at once, to be sure that you would
      never touch another card.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame!&rdquo; said the Prince with impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I know what I am risking by speaking thus. It weighs so heavily on my
      heart. I must give vent to it or I shall choke. You are spending money
      like a man who does not know what it is to earn it. And if you continue&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes raised her eyes and looked at the Prince. She saw him
      so pale with suppressed rage that she dared not say another word. She read
      deadly hatred in the young man&rsquo;s look. Frightened at what she had just
      been saying, she stepped back, and went quickly toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this money, Madame,&rdquo; said Serge, in a trembling voice. &ldquo;Take it, or
      all is over between us forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, seizing the notes, he put them by force in Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s
      hands. Then tearing up with rage the paper that had been the cause of this
      painful scene, he threw the pieces in the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deeply affected, Madame Desvarennes descended the stairs which she had a
      few minutes before gone up with so much resolution. She had a presentiment
      that an irreparable rupture had just taken place between herself and her
      son-in-law. She had ruffled Panine&rsquo;s pride. She felt that he would never
      forgive her. She went to her room sad and thoughtful. Life was becoming
      gloomy for this poor woman. Her confidence in herself had disappeared. She
      hesitated now, and was irresolute when she had to take a decision. She no
      longer went straight to the point by the shortest road. Her sonorous voice
      was softened. She was no longer the same willing energetic woman who
      feared no obstacles. She had known defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attitude of her daughter had changed toward her. It seemed as if
      Micheline wished to absolve herself of all complicity with Madame
      Desvarennes. She kept away to prove to her husband that if her mother had
      displeased him in any way, she had nothing to do with it. This behavior
      grieved her mother, who felt that Serge was working secretly to turn
      Micheline against her. And the mad passion of the young wife for him whom
      she recognized as her master did not allow the mother to doubt which side
      she would take if ever she had to choose between husband and mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Micheline came down to see her mother. It was more than a month
      since she had visited her. In a moment Madame Desvarennes saw that she had
      something of an embarrassing nature to speak of. To begin with she was
      more affectionate than usual, seeming to wish with the honey of her kisses
      to sweeten the bitter cross which the mistress was doomed to bear. Then
      she hesitated. She fidgeted about the room humming. At last she said that
      the doctor had come at the request of Serge, who was most anxious about
      his wife&rsquo;s health. And that excellent Doctor Rigaud, who had known her
      from a child, had found her suffering from great weakness. He had ordered
      change of air.
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words Madame Desvarennes raised her head and gave her daughter a
      terrible look:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, no nonsense! Speak the truth! He is taking you away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, mamma,&rdquo; said Micheline, disconcerted at this interruption, &ldquo;I assure
      you, you are mistaken. Anxiety for my health alone guides my husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband!&rdquo; broke forth Madame Desvarennes. &ldquo;Your husband! Ah, there;
      go away! Because if you stop here, I shall not be able to control myself,
      and shall say things about him that you will not forgive in a hurry! As
      you are ill, you are right to have change of air. I shall remain here,
      without you, fastened to my chain, earning money for you while you are
      far, away. Go along!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And seizing her daughter by the arm with convulsive strength, she pushed
      her roughly; for the first time in her life, repeating, in a low tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away! Leave me alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Micheline suffered herself to be put outside the room, and went to her own
      apartments astonished and frightened. The young wife had hardly left the
      room when Madame Desvarennes suffered the reaction of the emotion she had
      just felt. Her nerves were unstrung, and falling on a chair she remained
      immovable and humbled. Was it possible that her daughter, her adored
      child, would abandon her to obey the grudges of her husband? No,
      Micheline, when back in her room, would remember that she was carrying
      away all the joy of the house, and that it was cruel to deprive her mother
      of her only happiness in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slightly reassured, she went down to the office. As she reached the
      landing, she saw the Prince&rsquo;s servants carrying up trunks belonging to
      their master to be packed. She felt sick at heart. She understood that
      this project had been discussed and settled beforehand. It seemed to her
      that all was over; that her daughter was going away forever, and that she
      would never see her again. She thought of going to beseech Serge and ask
      him what sum he would take in exchange for Micheline&rsquo;s liberty; but the
      haughty and sarcastic face of the Prince forcibly putting the bank-notes
      in her hands, passed before her, and she guessed that she would not obtain
      anything. Cast down and despairing, she entered her office and set to
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, by the evening express, the Prince and Princess left for
      Nice with all their household, and the mansion in the Rue Saint-Dominique
      remained silent and deserted.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. A SUDDEN JOURNEY
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the end of the Promenade des Anglais, on the pleasant road bordered
      with tamarind-trees, stands, amid a grove of cork-oaks and eucalypti, a
      charming white villa with pink shutters. A Russian lady, the Countess
      Woreseff, had it built five years ago, and occupied it one winter. Then,
      tired of the monotonous noise of the waves beating on the terrace and the
      brightness of the calm blue sky, she longed for the mists of her native
      country, and suddenly started for St. Petersburg, leaving that charming
      residence to be let.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was there, amid rhododendrons and strawberry-trees in full bloom, that
      Micheline and Serge had taken up their abode. Until that day the Princess
      had scarcely travelled. Her mother, always occupied in commercial
      pursuits, had never left Paris. Micheline had remained with her. During
      this long journey, accomplished in most luxurious style, she had behaved
      like a child astonished at everything, and pleased at the least thing.
      With her face close to the window she saw through the transparent darkness
      of a lovely winter&rsquo;s night, villages and forests gliding past like
      phantoms. Afar off, in the depths of the country, she caught sight of a
      light glimmering, and she loved to picture a family gathered by the fire,
      the children asleep and the mother working in the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Children! She often thought of them, and never without a sigh of regret
      rising to her lips. She had been married for some months, and her dreams
      of becoming a mother had not been realized. How happy she would have been
      to have a baby, with fair hair, to fondle and kiss! Then the idea of a
      child reminded her of her own mother. She thought of the deep love one
      must feel for a child. And the image of the mistress, sad and alone, in
      the large house of the Rue Saint-Dominique, came to her mind. A vague
      remorse seized her heart. She felt she had behaved badly. She said to
      herself: &ldquo;If, to punish me, Heaven will not grant me a child!&rdquo; She wept,
      and soon her grief and trouble vanished with her tears. Sleep overpowered
      her, and when she awoke it was broad daylight and they were in Provence.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment everything was dazzling. The arrival at Marseilles; the
      journey along the coast, the approach to Nice, were all matters of ecstacy
      to Micheline. But it was when the carriage, which was waiting for them at
      the railway station, stopped at the gates of the villa, that she broke
      into raptures. She could not feast her eyes enough on the scene which was
      before her. The blue sea, the sky without a cloud, the white houses rising
      on the hill amid the dark foliage, and in the distance the mountaintops
      covered with snow, and tinged with pink under the brilliant rays of the
      sun. All this vigorous and slightly wild nature surprised the Parisienne.
      It was a new experience. Dazzled by the light and intoxicated with the
      perfumes, a sort of languor came over her. She soon recovered and became
      quite strong&mdash;something altogether new for her, and she felt
      thoroughly happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The life of the Prince and the Princess became at Nice what it had been in
      Paris during the early days of their marriage. Visitors flocked to their
      house. All that the colony could reckon of well-known Parisians and
      foreigners of high repute presented themselves at the villa. The fetes
      recommenced. They gave receptions three times a week; the other evenings
      Serge went to the Cercle.
    </p>
    <p>
      This absorbing life had gone on for two months. It was the beginning of
      February, and already nature was assuming a new appearance under the
      influence of spring. One evening, three people&mdash;two gentlemen and a
      lady&mdash;stepped out of a carriage at the villa gates, and found
      themselves face to face with a traveller who had come on foot. Two
      exclamations broke out simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marechal!&rdquo; &ldquo;Monsieur Savinien!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! at Nice? And by what miracle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A miracle which makes you travel fifteen leagues an hour in exchange for
      a hundred and thirty-three francs first-class, and is called the
      Marseilles express!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, my dear friend. I have not introduced you to Monsieur
      and Mademoiselle Herzog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already had the honor of meeting Mademoiselle Herzog at Madame
      Desvarennes&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Marechal, bowing to the young girl, without appearing
      to notice the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were going to the villa?&rdquo; asked Savinien. &ldquo;We, too, were going. But
      how is my aunt? When did you leave her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not left her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say that she is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Savinien let his arms drop in profound consternation to show how difficult
      it was for him to believe what was going on. Then, in a faint treble
      voice, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My aunt! At Nice! Promenade des Anglais! That&rsquo;s something more wonderful
      than the telephone and phonograph! If you had told me that the Pantheon
      had landed one fine night on the banks of the Paillon, I should not be
      more astonished. I thought Madame Desvarennes was as deeply rooted in
      Paris as the Colonne Vendome! But tell me, what is the object of this
      journey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A freak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which manifested itself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday morning at breakfast. Pierre Delarue, who is going to finish
      his business in Algeria, and then settle in France, came to say &lsquo;Good-by&rsquo; 
      to Madame Desvarennes. A letter arrived from the Princess. She commenced
      reading it, then all at once she exclaimed &lsquo;Cayrol and his wife arrived at
      Nice two days ago!&rsquo; Pierre and I were astonished at the tone in which she
      uttered these words. She was lost in thought for a few moments, then she
      said to Pierre: &lsquo;You are leaving tonight for Marseilles? Well, I shall go
      with you. You will accompany me to Nice.&rsquo; And turning toward me, she
      added: &lsquo;Marechal, pack up your portmanteau. I shall take you with me.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      While speaking, they had walked across the garden, and reached the steps
      leading to the villa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is easier than to explain this sudden journey,&rdquo; remarked
      Mademoiselle Herzog. &ldquo;On learning that Monsieur and Madame Cayrol were at
      Nice with the Princess, Madame Desvarennes must have felt how very lonely
      she was in Paris. She had a longing to be near them, and started.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herzog listened attentively, and seemed to be seeking the connection which
      should exist between the arrival of the Cayrols and the departure of
      Madame Desvarennes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The funniest thing to me is Marechal taking a holiday,&rdquo; observed
      Savinien. &ldquo;They are still at dinner,&rdquo; he added, entering the drawing-room,
      through the great doors of which sounds of voices and rattling of plates
      were heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let us wait for them; we are in agreeable company,&rdquo; said Herzog,
      turning toward Marechal, who only answered by a cold bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do here, Marechal?&rdquo; inquired Savinien. &ldquo;You will be
      awfully bored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Once in a way I am going to enjoy myself and be a swell. You will
      teach me, Monsieur Savinien. It cannot be very difficult. It is only
      necessary to wear a dove-colored coat like you, a gardenia in my
      buttonhole like Monsieur Le Bride, frizzled hair like Monsieur du
      Tremblay, and to assail the bank at Monaco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like all these gentlemen,&rdquo; said Suzanne, gayly, &ldquo;you are a gambler then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never touched a card.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then you ought to have great good luck,&rdquo; said the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herzog had come up to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go partners?&rdquo; he asked of Marechal. &ldquo;We will divide the
      winnings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too kind,&rdquo; replied Marechal, dryly, turning away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not get used to Herzog&rsquo;s familiarity, and there was something in
      the man which displeased him greatly. There was, he thought, a
      police-court atmosphere about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suzanne, on the contrary, interested him. The simple, lively, and frank
      young girl attracted him, and he liked to talk with her. On several
      occasions, at Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s, he had been her partner. There was
      through this a certain intimacy between them which he could not extend to
      the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herzog had that faculty, fortunately for him, of never appearing offended
      at what was said to him. He took Savinien&rsquo;s arm in a familiar manner and
      asked: &ldquo;Have you noticed that the Prince has looked very preoccupied for
      the last few days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at it,&rdquo; replied Savinien. &ldquo;He has been very unlucky at
      cards. It is all very well for his wife, my charming cousin, to be rich,
      but if he is going on like that it won&rsquo;t last long!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men withdrew to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suzanne went up to Marechal. She had resumed her thoughtful air. He saw
      her advancing, and, guessing what she was going to say, felt uncomfortable
      at having to tell an untruth if he did not wish to hurt her feelings by
      brutal frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Marechal,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;how is it that you are always so cold and
      formal with my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young lady, there is a great difference between your father and
      me. I keep my place, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl shook her head sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not that; you are amiable and ever friendly with me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a woman, and the least politeness&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! My father must have hurt your feelings unwittingly; for he is very
      good. I have asked him, and he did not seem to understand what I meant.
      But my questions drew his attention to you. He thinks highly of you and
      would like to see you filling a position more in harmony with your merit.
      You know that Monsieur Cayrol and my father have just launched a
      tremendous undertaking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The &lsquo;Credit European&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. They will have offices in all the commercial centres of European
      commerce. Would you like the management of one of these branches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, Mademoiselle?&rdquo; cried Marechal, astonished, and already asking himself
      what interest Herzog could have in making him leave the house of
      Desvarennes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The enterprise is colossal,&rdquo; continued Suzanne, &ldquo;and frightens me at
      times. Is it necessary to be so rich? I would like my father to retire
      from these enormous speculations into which he has thrown himself, body
      and soul. I have simple tastes. My father wishes to make a tremendous
      fortune for me, he says. All he undertakes is for me, I know. It seems to
      me that he runs a great risk. That is why I am talking to you. I am very
      superstitious, and I fancy if you were with us it would bring us luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suzanne, while speaking, had leaned toward Marechal. Her face reflected
      the seriousness of her thoughts. Her lovely eyes implored. The young man
      asked himself how this charming girl could belong to that horrible Herzog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me that I am deeply touched, Mademoiselle, by the favor you have
      done me,&rdquo; said he, with emotion. &ldquo;I owe it solely to your kindness, I
      know; but I do not belong to myself. I am bound to Madame Desvarennes by
      stronger ties than those of interest&mdash;those of gratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You refuse?&rdquo; she cried, painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The position you fill is humble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was very glad to accept it at a time when my daily bread was not
      certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been reduced,&rdquo; said the young girl, with trembling voice, &ldquo;to
      such&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretchedness. Yes, Mademoiselle, my outset in life was hard. I am without
      relations. Mother Marechal, a kind fruiterer of the Rue Pavee au Marais,
      found me one morning by the curbstone, rolled in a number of the
      Constitutionnel, like an old pair of boots. The good woman took me home,
      brought me up and sent me to college. I must tell you that I was very
      successful and gained a scholarship. I won all the prizes. Yes, and I had
      to sell my gilt-edged books from the Lycee Charlemagne in the days of
      distress. I was eighteen when my benefactress, Mother Marechal, died. I
      was without help or succor. I tried to get along by myself. After ten
      years of struggling and privations I felt physical and moral vigor giving
      way. I looked around me and saw those who overcame obstacles were stronger
      than I. I felt that I was doomed not to make way in the world, not being
      one of those who could command, so I resigned myself to obey. I fill a
      humble position as you know, but one which satisfies my wants. I am
      without ambition. A little philosophical, I observe all that goes on
      around me. I live happily like Diogenes in his tub.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a wise man,&rdquo; resumed Suzanne. &ldquo;I, too, am a philosopher, and I
      live amid surroundings which do not please me. I, unfortunately, lost my
      mother when I was very young, and although my father is very kind, he has
      been obliged to neglect me a little. I see around me people who are
      millionaires or who aspire to be. I am doomed to receive the attentions of
      such men as Le Bride and Du Tremblay&mdash;empty-headed coxcombs, who
      court my money, and to whom I am not a woman, but a sack of ducats trimmed
      with lace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These gentlemen are the modern Argonauts. They are in search of the
      Golden Fleece,&rdquo; observed Marechal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Argonauts!&rdquo; cried Suzanne, laughing. &ldquo;You are right. I shall never
      call them anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they will not understand you!&rdquo; said Marechal, gayly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
      they know much of mythology.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see I am not very happy in the bosom of riches,&rdquo; continued the
      young girl. &ldquo;Do not abandon me. Come and talk with me sometimes. You will
      not chatter trivialities. It will be a change from the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, nodding pleasantly to Marechal, Mademoiselle Herzog joined her
      father, who was gleaning details about the house of Desvarennes from
      Savinien.
    </p>
    <p>
      The secretary remained silent for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange girl!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;What a pity she has such a father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door of the room in which Monsieur and Mademoiselle Herzog, Marechal
      and Savinien were, opened, and Madame Desvarennes entered, followed by her
      daughter, Cayrol, Serge and Pierre. The room, at the extreme end of the
      villa, was square, surrounded on three sides by a gallery shut in by glass
      and stocked with greenhouse plants. Lofty archways, half veiled with
      draperies, led to the gallery. This room had been the favorite one of
      Countess Woreseff. She had furnished it in Oriental style, with low seats
      and large divans, inviting one to rest and dream during the heat of the
      day. In the centre of the apartment was a large ottoman, the middle of
      which formed a flower-stand. Steps led down from the gallery to the
      terrace whence there was a most charming view of sea and land.
    </p>
    <p>
      On seeing his aunt enter, Savinien rushed forward and seized both her
      hands. Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s arrival was an element of interest in his
      unoccupied life. The dandy guessed at some mysterious business and thought
      it possible that he might get to know it. With open ears and prying eyes,
      he sought the meaning of the least words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you knew, my dear aunt, how surprised I am to see you here,&rdquo; he
      exclaimed in his hypocritical way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more so than I am to find myself here,&rdquo; said she, with a smile. &ldquo;But,
      bah! I have slipped my traces for a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are you going to do here?&rdquo; continued Savinien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What everybody does. By-the-bye, what do they do?&rdquo; asked Madame
      Desvarennes, with vivacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; answered the Prince. &ldquo;There are two distinct populations
      here. On the one hand, those who take care of themselves; on the other,
      those who enjoy themselves. For the former there is the constitutional
      every morning in the sun, with slow measured steps on the Promenade des
      Anglais. For the latter there are excursions, races, regattas. The first
      economize their life like misers; the second waste it like prodigals. Then
      night comes on, and the air grows cold. Those who take care of themselves
      go home, those who amuse themselves go out. The first put on
      dressing-gowns; the second put on ball-dresses. Here, the house is quiet,
      lit up by a night-light; there, the rooms sparkle with light, and resound
      with the noise of music and dancing. Here they cough, there they laugh.
      Infusion on the one hand, punch on the other. In fact, everywhere and
      always, a contrast. Nice is at once the saddest and the gayest town. One
      dies of over-enjoyment, and one amuses one&rsquo;s self at the risk of dying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sojourn here is very dangerous, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! aunt, not so dangerous, nor, above all, so amusing as the Prince
      says. We are a set of jolly fellows, who kill time between the dining-room
      of the hotel, pigeon-shooting, and the Cercle, which is not so very
      amusing after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dining-room is bearable,&rdquo; said Marechal, &ldquo;but pigeon-shooting must in
      time become&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We put some interest into the game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! It is very simple: a gentleman with a gun in his hand stands before
      the boxes which contain the pigeons. You say to me: &lsquo;I bet fifty louis
      that the bird will fall.&rsquo; I answer, &lsquo;Done.&rsquo; The gentleman calls out,
      &lsquo;Pull;&rsquo; the box opens, the pigeon flies, the shot follows. The bird falls
      or does not fall. I lose or win fifty louis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most interesting!&rdquo; exclaimed Mademoiselle Herzog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said Savinien with ironical indifference, &ldquo;it takes the place of
      &lsquo;trente et quarante,&rsquo; and is better than &lsquo;odd or even&rsquo; on the numbers of
      the cabs which pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do the pigeons say to that?&rdquo; asked Pierre, seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not consulted,&rdquo; said Serge, gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there are races and regattas,&rdquo; continued Savinien.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In which case you bet on the horses?&rdquo; interrupted Marechal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or on the boats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact, betting is applied to all circumstances of life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly; and to crown all, we have the Cercle, where we go in the
      evening. Baccarat triumphs there. It is not very varied either: A hundred
      louis? Done&mdash;Five. I draw. There are some people who draw at five.
      Nine, I show up, I win or I lose, and the game continues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that amid the glare of gas and the smoke of tobacco,&rdquo; said Marechal,
      &ldquo;when the nights are so splendid and the orange-trees smell so sweetly.
      What a strange existence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An existence for idiots, Marechal,&rdquo; sighed Savinien, &ldquo;that I, a man of
      business, must submit to, through my aunt&rsquo;s domineering ways! You know now
      how men of pleasure spend their lives, my friend, and you might write a
      substantial resume entitled, &lsquo;The Fool&rsquo;s Breviary.&rsquo; I am sure it would
      sell well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes, who had heard the last words, was no longer listening.
      She was lost in a deep reverie. She was much altered since grief and
      trouble had come upon her; her face was worn, her temples hollow, her chin
      was more prominent. Her eyes had sunk into her head, and were surrounded
      by dark rims.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge, leaning against the wall near the window, was observing her. He was
      wondering with secret anxiety what had brought Madame Desvarennes so
      suddenly to his house after a separation of two months, during which time
      she had scarcely written to Micheline. Was the question of money to be
      resumed? Since the morning Madame had been smiling, calm and pleased like
      a schoolgirl home for her holidays. This was the first time she had
      allowed a sad expression to rest on her face. Her gayety was feigned then.
    </p>
    <p>
      A look crossing his made him start. Jeanne had just turned her eyes toward
      him. For a second they met his own. Serge could not help shuddering.
      Jeanne was calling his attention to Madame Desvarennes; she, too, was
      observing her. Was it on their account she had come to Nice? Had their
      secret fallen into her hands? He resolved to find out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne had turned away her eyes from him. He could feast his on her now.
      She had become more beautiful. The tone of her complexion had become
      warmer. Her figure had developed. Serge longed to call her his own. For a
      moment his hands trembled; his throat was dry, his heart seemed to stop
      beating.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to shake off this attraction, and walked to the centre of the
      room. At the same time visitors were announced. Le Bride, with his
      inseparable friend, Du Tremblay, escorting Lady Harton, Serge&rsquo;s beautiful
      cousin, who had caused Micheline some anxiety on the day of her marriage,
      but whom she no longer feared; then the Prince and Princess Odescalchi,
      Venetian nobles, followed by Monsieur Clement Souverain, a young Belgian,
      starter of the Nice races, a great pigeon shot, and a mad leader of
      cotillons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear me! my lady, all in black?&rdquo; said Micheline, pointing to the
      tight-fitting black satin worn by the English beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear Princess; mourning,&rdquo; replied Lady Harton, with a vigorous
      shake of the hands. &ldquo;Ball-room mourning&mdash;one of my best partners;
      gentlemen, you know Harry Tornwall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Countess Alberti&rsquo;s cavalier?&rdquo; added Serge. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! he has just killed himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A concert of exclamations arose in the drawing-room, and the visitors
      suddenly surrounded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! did you not know? It was the sole topic of conversation at Monaco
      to-day. Poor Tornwall, being completely cleared out, went during the night
      to the park belonging to the villa occupied by Countess Alberti, and blew
      his brains out under her window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dreadful!&rdquo; exclaimed Micheline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very bad taste on your countryman&rsquo;s part,&rdquo; observed Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Countess was furious, and said that Tornwall&rsquo;s coming to her house to
      kill himself proved clearly to her that he did not know how to behave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish to prevent those who are cleared out from blowing out their
      brains?&rdquo; inquired Cayrol. &ldquo;Compel the pawnbrokers of Monaco to lend a
      louis on all pistols.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; retorted young Monsieur Souverain, &ldquo;when the louis is lost the
      players will still be able to hang themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; concluded Marechal, &ldquo;then at any rate the rope will bring luck to
      others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, do you know that what you have been relating to us is very
      doleful?&rdquo; said Suzanne Herzog. &ldquo;Suppose, to vary our impressions, you were
      to ask us to waltz?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, on the terrace,&rdquo; said Le Brede, warmly. &ldquo;A curtain of orange-trees
      will protect us from the vulgar gaze.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Mademoiselle, what a dream!&rdquo; sighed Du Tremblay, approaching Suzanne.
      &ldquo;Waltzing with you! By moonlight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, friend Pierrot!&rdquo; sang Suzanne, bursting into a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already the piano, vigorously attacked by Pierre, desirous of making
      himself useful since he could not be agreeable, was heard in the next
      room. Serge had slowly approached Jeanne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you do me the favor of dancing with me?&rdquo; he asked, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman started; her cheeks became pale, and in a sharp tone she
      answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ask your wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You or nobody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne raised her eyes boldly, and looking at him in the face, said,
      defiantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, nobody!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, rising, she took the arm of Cayrol, who was advancing toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince remained motionless for a moment, following them with his eyes.
      Then, seeing his wife alone with Madame Desvarennes, he went out on the
      terrace. Already the couples were dancing on the polished marble. Joyful
      bursts of laughter rose in the perfumed air that sweet March night. A deep
      sorrow came over Serge; an intense disgust with all things. The sea
      sparkled, lit up by the moon. He had a mad longing to seize Jeanne in his
      arms and carry her far away from the world, across that immense calm space
      which seemed made expressly to rock sweetly eternal loves.

      CHAPTER XV. MOTHER AND DAUGHTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Micheline intended following her husband, but Madame Desvarennes, without
      rising, took hold of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay with me for a little while,&rdquo; she said, tenderly. &ldquo;We have scarcely
      exchanged ten words since my arrival. Come, tell me, are you pleased to
      see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you ask me that?&rdquo; answered Micheline, seating herself on the sofa
      beside her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask you so that you may tell me so,&rdquo; resumed Madame Desvarennes,
      softly. &ldquo;I know what you think, but that is not enough.&rdquo; She added
      pleadingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Micheline threw her arms round her mother&rsquo;s neck, saying, &ldquo;Dear mamma!&rdquo;
       which made tears spring to the tortured mother&rsquo;s eyes. She folded
      her-daughter in her arms, and clasped her as a miser holds his treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a long time since I have heard you speak thus to me. Two months!
      And I have been desolate in that large house you used to fill alone in the
      days gone by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young wife interrupted her mother, reproachfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! mamma; I beg you to be reasonable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be reasonable? In other words, I suppose you mean that I am to get
      accustomed to living without you, after having for twenty years devoted my
      life to you? Bear, without complaining, that my happiness should be taken
      away, and now that I am old lead a life without aim, without joy, without
      trouble even, because I know if you had any troubles you would not tell
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s pause. Then Micheline, in a constrained manner, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What griefs could I have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes lost all patience, and giving vent to her feelings
      exclaimed, bitterly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those which your husband causes you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Micheline arose abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the mistress had commenced, and with unrestrained bitterness, went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That gentleman has behaved toward me in such a manner as to shake my
      confidence in him! After vowing that he would never separate you from me,
      he brought you here, knowing that I could not leave Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are unjust,&rdquo; retorted Micheline. &ldquo;You know the doctors ordered me to
      go to Nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! You can make doctors order you anything you like!&rdquo; resumed her
      mother, excitedly, and shaking her head disdainfully. &ldquo;Your husband said
      to our good Doctor Rigaud: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that a season in the South
      would do my wife good?&rsquo; The doctor answered: &lsquo;If it does not do her any
      good it certainly won&rsquo;t do her any harm.&rsquo; Then your husband added, &lsquo;just
      take a sheet of paper and write out a prescription. You understand? It is
      for my mother-in-law, who will not be pleased at our going away.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as Micheline seemed to doubt what she was saying, the latter added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor told me when I went to see him about it. I never had much
      faith in doctors, and now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Micheline felt she was on delicate ground, and wanted to change the
      subject. She soothed her mother as in days gone by, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, mamma; will you never be able to get used to your part? Must you
      always be jealous? You know all wives leave their mothers to follow their
      husbands. It is the law of nature. You, in your day, remember, followed
      your husband, and your mother must have wept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did my mother love me as I love you?&rdquo; asked Madame Desvarennes,
      impetuously. &ldquo;I was brought up differently. We had not time to love each
      other so much. We had to work. The happiness of spoiling one&rsquo;s child is a
      privilege of the rich. For you there was no down warm enough or silk soft
      enough to line your cradle. You have been petted and worshipped for twenty
      years. Yet, it only needed a man, whom you scarcely knew six months ago,
      to make you forget everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not forgotten anything,&rdquo; replied Micheline, moved by these
      passionate expressions. &ldquo;And in my heart you still hold the same place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mistress looked at the young wife, then, in a sad tone, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no longer the first place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This simple, selfish view made Micheline smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is just like you, you tyrant!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You must be first.
      Come, be satisfied with equality! Remember that you were first in the
      field, and that for twenty years I have loved you, while he has to make up
      for lost time. Don&rsquo;t try to make a comparison between my love for him and
      my affection for you. Be kind: instead of looking black at him, try to
      love him. I should be so happy to see you united, and to be able, without
      reservation, to think of you both with the same tenderness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! how you talk me over. How charming and caressing you can be when you
      like. And how happy Serge ought to be with a wife like you! It is always
      the way; men like him always get the best wives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose, mamma, you came all the way from Paris to run down my
      husband to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes became serious again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I came to defend you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Micheline looked surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is time for me to speak. You are seriously menaced,&rdquo; continued the
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my love?&rdquo; asked the young wife, in an altered tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; in your fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Micheline smiled superbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that be all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This indifference made her mother positively jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak very coolly about it! At the rate your husband is spending,
      there will be nothing left of your dowry in six months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said the Princess, gayly, &ldquo;you will give us another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes assumed her cold businesslike manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ta! ta! ta! Do you think there is no limit to my resources? I gave you
      four millions when you were married, represented by fifteen hundred
      thousand francs, in good stock, a house in the Rue de Rivoli, and eight
      hundred thousand francs which I prudently kept in the business, and for
      which I pay you interest. The fifteen hundred thousand francs have
      vanished. My lawyer came to tell me that the house in the Rue de Rivoli
      had been sold without a reinvestment taking place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mistress stopped. She had spoken in that frank, determined, way of
      hers that was part of her strength. She looked fixedly at Micheline, and
      asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know this, my girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Princess, deeply troubled, because now it was not a question of
      sentiment, but of serious moment, answered, in a low tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mamma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that possible?&rdquo; Madame Desvarennes demanded, hotly. &ldquo;Nothing can
      be done without your signature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave it,&rdquo; murmured Micheline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gave it!&rdquo; repeated the mistress in a tone of anger. &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day after my marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband had the impudence to ask for it the day after your
      marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Micheline smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not ask for it, mamma,&rdquo; she replied, with sweetness; &ldquo;I offered it
      to him. You had settled all on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prudently! With a fellow like your husband!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mistrust must have been humiliating to him. I was ashamed of it. I
      said nothing to you, because I knew you would rather prevent the marriage,
      and I loved Serge. I, therefore, signed the contract which you had had
      prepared. Only the next day I gave a general power of attorney to my
      husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s anger was over. She was observing Micheline, and
      wished to find out the depth of the abyss into which her daughter had
      thrown herself with blind confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did he say then?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered Micheline, simply. &ldquo;Tears came to his eyes, and he
      kissed me. I saw that this delicacy touched his heart and I was happy.
      There, mamma,&rdquo; she added with eyes sparkling at the remembrance of the
      pleasure she had experienced, &ldquo;he may spend as much as he likes; I am
      amply repaid beforehand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes shrugged her shoulders, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear child, you are mad enough to be locked up. What is there about
      the fellow to turn every woman&rsquo;s brain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every woman&rsquo;s?&rdquo; exclaimed Micheline, anxiously, looking at her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a manner of speaking. But, my dear, you must understand that I
      cannot be satisfied with what you have just told me. A tear and a kiss!
      Bah! That is not worth your dowry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, mamma, do let me be happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can be happy without committing follies. You do not need a
      racing-stable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he has chosen such pretty colors,&rdquo; interrupted Micheline, with a
      smile. &ldquo;Pearl-gray and silver, and pink cap. It is charming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so? Well, you are not difficult to please. And the club? What
      do you say to his gambling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Micheline turned pale, and with a constraint which hurt her mother, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it necessary to make a fuss about a few games at bouillotte?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This continual defense of Serge exasperated Madame Desvarennes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me,&rdquo; she continued, violently. &ldquo;I am well informed on that
      subject. He leaves you alone every evening to go and play with gentlemen
      who turn up the king with a dexterity the Legitimists must envy. My dear,
      shall I tell you his fortune? He commenced with cards; he continues with
      horses; he will finish with worthless women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma!&rdquo; cried Micheline, wounded to the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your money will pay the piper! But, happily, I am here to put your
      household matters right. I am going to keep your gentleman so well under
      that in future he will walk straight, I&rsquo;ll warrant you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Micheline rose and stood before her mother, looking so pale that the
      latter was frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she said, in trembling tones, &ldquo;if ever you say one word to my
      husband, take care! I shall never see you again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes flinched before her daughter. It was no longer the weak
      Micheline who trusted to her tears, but a vehement woman ready to defend
      him whom she loved. And as she remained silent, not daring to speak again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; continued Micheline, with sadness, yet firmly, &ldquo;this explanation
      was inevitable; I have suffered beforehand, knowing that I should have to
      choose between my affection for my husband and my respect for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between the one and the other,&rdquo; said the mistress, bitterly, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t
      hesitate, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my duty; and if I failed in it, you yourself, with your good sense,
      would see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Micheline, could I have expected to find you thus?&rdquo; cried the mother,
      in despair. &ldquo;What a change! It is not you who are speaking; it is not my
      daughter. Fool that you are! Don&rsquo;t you see whither you are being led? You,
      yourself, are preparing your own misfortune. Don&rsquo;t think that my words are
      inspired by jealousy. A higher sentiment dictates them, and at this moment
      my maternal love gives me, I fear, a foresight of the future. There is
      only just time to rescue you from the danger into which you are running.
      You hope to retain your husband by your generosity? There where you think
      you are giving proofs of love he will only see proofs of weakness. If you
      make yourself cheap he will count you as nothing. If you throw yourself at
      his feet he will trample on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Princess shook her head haughtily, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know him, mamma. He is a gentleman; he understands all these
      delicacies, and there is more to be gained by submitting one&rsquo;s self to his
      discretion, than by trying to resist his will. You blame his manner of
      existence, but you don&rsquo;t understand him. I know him. He belongs to a
      different race than you and I. He needs refinements of luxury which would
      be useless to us, but the deprivation of which would be hard to him. He
      suffered much when he was poor, he is making up for it now. We are guilty
      of some extravagances, &lsquo;tis true; but what does it matter? For whom have
      you made a fortune? For me! For what object? My happiness! Well, I am
      happy to surround my Prince with the glory and pomp which suits him so
      well. He is grateful to me; he loves me, and I hold his love dearer than
      all else in the world; for if ever he ceases to love me I shall die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Micheline!&rdquo; cried Madame Desvarennes, beside herself, and seizing her
      daughter with nervous strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young wife quietly allowed her fair head to fall on her mother&rsquo;s
      shoulder, and whispered faintly in her ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to wreck my life. I understand your displeasure. It is
      natural; I feel it. You cannot think otherwise than you do, being a
      simple, hardworking woman; but I beg of you to banish all hatred, and
      confine these ideas within yourself. Say nothing more about them for love
      of me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother was vanquished. She had never been able to resist that
      suppliant voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! cruel child,&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;what pain you are causing me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You consent, don&rsquo;t you, dear mother?&rdquo; murmured Micheline, falling into
      the arms of her by whom she knew she was adored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do as you wish,&rdquo; said Madame Desvarennes, kissing her daughter&rsquo;s
      hair&mdash;that golden hair which, in former days, she loved to stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strains of the piano sounded on the terrace. In the shade, groups of
      merry dancers were enjoying themselves. Happy voices were heard
      approaching, and Savinien, followed by Marechal and Suzanne, came briskly
      up the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, aunt, it is not fair,&rdquo; said the dandy. &ldquo;If you have come here to
      monopolize Micheline, you will be sent back to Paris. We want a vis-a-vis
      for a quadrille. Come, Princess, it is delightfully cool outside, and I am
      sure you will enjoy it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Le Brede has gathered some oranges, and is trying to play at cup
      and ball with them on his nose, while his friend, Monsieur du Tremblay,
      jealous of his success, talks of illuminating the trees with bowls of
      punch,&rdquo; said Marechal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is Serge doing?&rdquo; inquired Micheline, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is talking to my wife on the terrace,&rdquo; said Cayrol, appearing in the
      gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young people went off and were lost in the darkness. Madame
      Desvarennes looked at Cayrol. He was happy and calm. There was no trace of
      his former jealousy. During the six months which had elapsed since his
      marriage, the banker had observed his wife closely, her actions, her
      words: nothing had escaped him. He had never found her at fault. Thus,
      reassured, he had given her his confidence and this time forever. Jeanne
      was adorable; he loved her more than ever. She seemed very much changed to
      him. Her disposition, formerly somewhat harsh, had softened, and the
      haughty, capricious girl had become a mild, demure, and somewhat serious
      woman. Unable to read his companion&rsquo;s thoughts, Cayrol sincerely believed
      that he had been unnecessarily anxious, and that Jeanne&rsquo;s troubles had
      only been passing fancies. He took credit of the change in his wife to
      himself, and was proud of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cayrol, oblige me by removing that lamp; it hurts my eyes,&rdquo; said Madame
      Desvarennes, anxious that the traces on her face, caused by her late
      discussion with her daughter, should not be visible. &ldquo;Then ask Jeanne to
      come here for a few minutes. I have something to say to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Cayrol, taking the lamp off the table and carrying it
      into the adjoining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darkness did Madame Desvarennes good. It refreshed her mind and calmed her
      brow. The noise of dancing reached her. She commenced thinking. So it had
      vainly tried to prove to her that a life of immoderate pleasure was not
      conducive to happiness. The young wife had stopped her ears so that she
      might not hear, and closed her eyes that she might not see. Her mother
      asked herself if she did not exaggerate the evil. Alas! no. She saw that
      she was not mistaken. Examining the society around her, men and women:
      everywhere was feverish excitement, dissipation, and nullity. You might
      rummage through their brains without finding one practical idea; in all
      their hearts, there was not one lofty aspiration. These people, in their
      daily life were like squirrels in a cage, and because they moved, they
      thought they were progressing. In them scepticism had killed belief;
      religion, family, country, were, as they phrased it, all humbug. They had
      only one aim, one passion&mdash;to enjoy themselves. Their watchword was
      &ldquo;pleasure.&rdquo; All those who did not perish of consumption would die in
      lunatic asylums.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was she doing in the midst of this rottenness? She, the woman of
      business? Could she hope to regenerate these poor wretches by her example?
      No! She could not teach them to be good, and they excelled in teaching
      others harm. She must leave this gilded vice, taking with her those she
      loved, and leave the idle and incompetent to consume and destroy
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt disgusted, and resolved to do all to tear Micheline away from the
      contagion. In the meantime she must question Jeanne. A shadow appeared on
      the threshold: it was hers. In the darkness of the gallery Serge crept
      behind her without being seen. He had been watching Jeanne, and seeing her
      go away alone, had followed her. In the angle of the large bay-window,
      opening into the garden, he waited with palpitating heart. Madame
      Desvarennes&rsquo;s voice was heard in the silence of the drawing-room; he
      listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Jeanne; our interview will be short, and it could not be
      delayed, for to-morrow I shall not be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are leaving so soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I only left Paris on my daughter&rsquo;s account, and on yours. My
      daughter knows what I had to tell her; now it is your turn! Why did you
      come to Nice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not do otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because my husband wished it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to have made him wish something else. Your power over him is
      absolute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s pause. Then Jeanne answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feared to insist lest I should awaken his suspicions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! But admitting that you came to Nice, why accept hospitality in this
      house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Micheline offered it to us,&rdquo; said Jeanne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And even that did not make you refuse. What part do you purpose playing
      here? After six months of honesty, are you going to change your mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge, behind his shelter, shuddered. Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s words were
      clear. She knew all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne&rsquo;s voice was indignant when she replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By what right do you insult me by such a suspicion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the right which you have given me in not keeping to your bargain. You
      ought to have kept out of the way, and I find you here, seeking danger and
      already trying those flirtations which are the forerunners of sin, and
      familiarizing yourself with evil before wholly giving yourself up to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame!&rdquo; cried Jeanne, passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer! Have you kept the promise you made me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the hopes which you held out to me been realized?&rdquo; replied Jeanne,
      with despair. &ldquo;For six months I have been away, and have I found peace of
      mind and heart? The duty which you pointed out to me as a remedy for the
      pain which tortured me I have fruitlessly followed. I have wept, hoping
      that the trouble within me would be washed away with my tears. I have
      prayed to Heaven, and asked that I might love my husband. But, no! That
      man is as odious to me as ever. Now I have lost all my illusions, and find
      myself joined to him for the rest of my days! I have to tell lies, to wear
      a mask, to smile! It is revolting, and I suffer! Now that you know what is
      passing within me, judge, and say whether your reproaches are not a
      useless cruelty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On hearing Jeanne, Madame Desvarennes felt herself moved with deep pity.
      She asked herself whether it was not unjust for that poor child to suffer
      so much. She had never done anything wrong, and her conduct was worthy of
      esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappy woman!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, unhappy, indeed,&rdquo; resumed Jeanne, &ldquo;because I have nothing to cling
      to, nothing to sustain me. My mind is afflicted with feverish thoughts, my
      heart made desolate with bitter regrets. My will alone protects me, and in
      a moment of weakness it may betray me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You still love him?&rdquo; asked Madame Desvarennes, in a deep voice which made
      Serge quiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I know? There are times when I think I hate him. What I have endured
      since I have been here is incredible! Everything galls me, irritates me.
      My husband is blind, Micheline unsuspicious, and Serge smiles quietly, as
      if he were preparing some treachery. Jealousy, anger, contempt, are all
      conflicting within me. I feel that I ought to go away, and still I feel a
      horrible delight in remaining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; said Madame Desvarennes. &ldquo;I pity you from my soul. Forgive
      my unjust words; you have done all in your power. You have had momentary
      weaknesses like all human beings. You must be helped, and may rely on me.
      I will speak to your husband to-morrow; he shall take you away. Lacking
      happiness, you must have peace. Go you are a brave heart, and if Heaven be
      just, you will be rewarded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge heard the sound of a kiss. In an embrace, the mother had blessed her
      adopted daughter. Then the Prince saw Madame Desvarennes go slowly past
      him. And the silence was broken only by the sobs of Jeanne who was half
      lying on the sofa in the darkness.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. THE TELLTALE KISS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Serge slipped from his hiding-place and came toward Jeanne. The carpet
      deadened the sound of his steps. The young woman was gazing into vacancy
      and breathing with difficulty. He looked at her for a moment without
      speaking; then, leaning over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true, Jeanne,&rdquo; he murmured, softly, &ldquo;that you hate me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne arose, bewildered, exclaiming,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Serge,&rdquo; answered the Prince, &ldquo;who has never ceased to love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A deep blush spread over the young woman&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Your language is unworthy of a man. I will not
      listen to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with a quick step she walked toward the gallery. Serge threw himself
      in her way, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must stop; you cannot escape me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is madness,&rdquo; exclaimed Jeanne, moving away. &ldquo;Do you forget where
      we are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you forget what you have just been saying?&rdquo; retorted Serge. &ldquo;I was
      there; I did not miss a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you heard me,&rdquo; said Jeanne, &ldquo;you know that everything separates us. My
      duty, yours, and my will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A will which is enforced, and against which your heart rebels. A will to
      which I will not submit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, Serge advanced toward her, trying to seize her in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; replied Jeanne. &ldquo;Micheline and my husband are there. You must
      be mad to forget it. If you come a step farther I shall call out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call, then!&rdquo; cried Serge, clasping her in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne tried to free herself from him, but could not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serge,&rdquo; she said, paling with mingled anguish and rapture in the arms of
      him whom she adored, &ldquo;what you are doing is cowardly and base!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A kiss stopped the words on her lips. Jeanne felt herself giving way. She
      made a supreme effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, Serge!&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;Have mercy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears of shame rolled down her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! you belong to me. The other, your husband, stole you from me. I take
      you back. I love you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young woman fell on a seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge repeated,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you! I love you! I love you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fearful longing took possession of Jeanne. She no longer pushed away the
      arms which clasped her. She placed her hands on Serge&rsquo;s shoulder, and with
      a deep sigh gave herself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      A profound silence reigned around. Suddenly a sound of approaching voices
      roused them, and at the same moment the heavy curtain which separated the
      room from the adjoining drawing-room was lifted. A shadow appeared on the
      threshold, as they were still in each other&rsquo;s arms. The stifled
      exclamation, &ldquo;O God!&rdquo; followed by a sob of agony, resounded. The door
      curtain fell, surrounding with its folds the unknown witness of that
      terrible scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne had risen, trying to collect her ideas. A sudden light dawned on
      her mind; she realized in a moment the extent of her crime, and uttering a
      cry of horror and despair, she escaped, followed by Serge, through the
      gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the heavy curtain was lifted again, and tottering, livid, almost
      dead, Micheline entered the room. Pierre, serious and cold, walked behind
      her. The Princess, feeling tired, had come into the house. Chance had led
      her there to witness this proof of misfortune and treason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both she and Delarue looked at each other, silent and overwhelmed. Their
      thoughts whirled through their brains with fearful rapidity. In a moment
      they looked back on their existence. He saw the pale betrothed of whom he
      had dreamed as a wife, who had willingly given herself to another, and who
      now found herself so cruelly punished. She measured the distance which
      separated these two men: the one good, loyal, generous; the other selfish,
      base, and unworthy. And seeing him whom she adored, so vile and base
      compared to him whom she had disdained, Micheline burst into bitter tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre tremblingly hastened toward her. The Princess made a movement to
      check him, but she saw on the face of her childhood&rsquo;s friend such sincere
      grief and honest indignation, that she felt as safe, with him as if he had
      really been her brother. Overcome, she let her head fall on his shoulder,
      and wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of approaching footsteps made Micheline arise. She recognized
      her husband&rsquo;s step, and hastily seizing Pierre&rsquo;s hand, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never breathe a word; forget what you have seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, with deep grief, she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Serge knew that I had seen him unawares he would never forgive me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drying her tears, and still tottering from the shock, she left the room.
      Pierre remained alone, quite stunned; pitying, yet blaming the poor woman,
      who, in her outraged love, still had the absurd courage to hold her tongue
      and to resign herself. Anger seized on him, and the more timid Micheline
      seemed herself, the more violent and passionate he felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge came back to the room. After the first moment of excitement, he had
      reflected, and wanted to know by whom he had been observed. Was it Madame
      Desvarennes, Micheline, or Cayrol, who had come in? At this idea he
      trembled, measuring the possible results of the imprudence he had been
      guilty of. He resolved to face the difficulty if it were either of these
      three interested parties, and to impose silence if he had to deal with an
      indifferent person. He took the lamp which Madame Desvarennes had a short
      time before asked Cayrol to remove and went into the room. Pierre was
      there alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men measured each other with their looks. Delarue guessed the
      anxiety of Serge, and the Prince understood the hostility of Pierre. He
      turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was you who came in?&rdquo; he asked, boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Pierre, with severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince hesitated for a second. He was evidently seeking a polite form
      to express his request. He did not find one, and in a threatening manner,
      he resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must hold your tongue, otherwise&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Otherwise?&rdquo; inquired Pierce, aggressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the use of threats?&rdquo; replied Serge, already calmed. &ldquo;Excuse me; I
      know that you will not tell; if not for my sake at least for that of
      others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for others,&rdquo; said Pierre, passionately; &ldquo;for others whom you have
      basely sacrificed, and who deserve all your respect and love; for Madame
      Desvarennes, whose high intelligence you have not been able to understand;
      for Micheline, whose tender heart you have not been able to appreciate.
      Yes, for their sakes I will hold my peace, not out of regard for you,
      because you neither deserve consideration nor esteem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince advanced a step, and exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pierre!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre did not move, and looking Serge in the face, continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth is unpleasant to you, still you must hear it. You act according
      to your fancies. Principles and morals, to which all men submit, are dead
      letters to you. Your own pleasure above all things, and always! That is
      your rule, eh? and so much the worse if ruin and trouble to others are the
      consequences? You only have to deal with two women, and you profit by it.
      But I warn you that if you continue to crush them I will be their
      defender.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge had listened to all this with disdainful impassibility, and when
      Pierre had finished, he smiled, snapped his fingers, and turning toward
      the young man:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;allow me to tell you that I think you are very
      impertinent. You come here meddling with my affairs. What authority have
      you? Are you a relative? A connection? By what right do you preach this
      sermon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he concluded, Serge seated himself and laughed with a careless air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre answered, gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was betrothed to Micheline when she saw and loved you: that is my
      right! I could have married her, but sacrificed my love to hers: that is
      my authority! And it is in the name of my shattered hopes and lost
      happiness that I call you to account for her future peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge had risen, he was deeply embittered at what Delarue had just told
      him, and was trying to recover his calmness. Pierre, trembling with
      emotion and anger, was also striving to check their influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said the Prince, mockingly, &ldquo;that in your claim there is
      more than the outcry of an irritated conscience; it is the complaint of a
      heart that still loves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if that were so?&rdquo; retorted Pierre. &ldquo;Yes, I love her, but with a pious
      love, from the depth of my soul, as one would love a saint; and I only
      suffer the more to see her suffering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat irritated the Prince exclaimed, impatiently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t let us have a lyric recitation; let us be brief and clear. What
      do you want? Explain yourself. I don&rsquo;t suppose that you have addressed
      this rebuke to me solely for the purpose of telling me that you are in
      love with my wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre disregarded what was insulting in the Prince&rsquo;s answer, and calming
      himself, by force of will, replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I desire, since you ask me, that you forget the folly and error of a
      moment, and that you swear to me on your honor never to see Madame Cayrol
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre&rsquo;s moderation wounded the Prince more than his rage had affected
      him. He felt petty beside this devoted friend, who only thought of the
      happiness of her whom he loved without hope. His temper increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what if I refuse to lend myself to those whims which you express so
      candidly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Pierre, resolutely, &ldquo;I shall remember that, when renouncing
      Micheline, I promised to be a brother to her, and if you compel me I will
      defend her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are threatening me, I think,&rdquo; cried Serge, beside himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I warn you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; said the Prince, scarcely able to command himself. &ldquo;For any
      little service you have rendered me, from henceforth we are quits. Don&rsquo;t
      think that I am one of those who yield to violence. Keep out of my path;
      it will be prudent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, then, to this. I am not one of those who shirk a duty, whatever
      the peril be in accomplishing it. You know what price I put on Micheline&rsquo;s
      happiness; you are responsible for it, and I shall oblige you to respect
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And leaving Serge dumb with suppressed rage, Pierre went out on the
      terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the high road the sound of the carriages bearing away Savinien, Herzog
      and his daughter, resounded in the calm starry night. In the villa
      everything was quiet. Pierre breathed with delight; he instinctively
      turned his eyes toward the brilliant sky, and in the far-off firmament,
      the star which he appropriated to himself long ago, and which he had so
      desperately looked for when he was unhappy, suddenly appeared bright and
      twinkling. He sighed and moved on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince spent a part of the night at the club; he was excessively
      nervous, and after alternate losses and gains, he retired, carrying off a
      goodly sum from his opponents. It was a long time since he had been so
      lucky, and on his way home he smiled when he thought how false was the
      proverb, &ldquo;Lucky at play, unlucky in love.&rdquo; He thought of that adorable
      Jeanne whom he had held in his arms a few hours before, and who had so
      eagerly clung to him. He understood that she had never ceased to belong to
      him. The image of Cayrol, self-confident man, happy in his love, coming to
      his mind, caused Serge to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no thought for Micheline; she had been the stepping-stone to
      fortune for him; he knew that she was gentle and thought her not very
      discerning. He could easily deceive her; with a few caresses and a little
      consideration he could maintain the illusion of his love for her. Madame
      Desvarennes alone inconvenienced him in his arrangements. She was
      sagacious, and on several occasions he had seen her unveil plots which he
      thought were well contrived. He must really beware of her. He had often
      noticed in her voice and look an alarming hardness. She was not a woman to
      be afraid of a scandal. On the contrary, she would hail it with joy, and
      be happy to get rid of him whom she hated with all her might.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of himself, Serge remembered the night of his union to Micheline,
      when he had said to Madame Desvarennes: &ldquo;Take my life; it is yours!&rdquo; She
      had replied seriously, and almost threateningly: &ldquo;Very well; I accept it!&rdquo;
       These words now resounded in his ears like a verdict. He promised himself
      to play a sure game with Madame Desvarennes. As to Cayrol, he was out of
      the question; he had only been created as a plaything for princes such as
      Serge; his destiny was written on his forehead, and he could not escape.
      If it had not been Panine, some one else would have done the same thing
      for him. Besides, how could that ex-cowherd expect to keep such a woman as
      Jeanne was to himself. It would have been manifestly unfair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince found his valet asleep in the hall. He went quickly to his
      bedroom, and slept soundly without remorse, without dreams, until noon.
      Coming down to breakfast, he found the family assembled. Savinien had come
      to see his aunt, before whom he wanted to place a &ldquo;colossal idea.&rdquo; This
      time, he said, it was worth a fortune. He hoped to draw six thousand
      francs from the mistress who, according to her usual custom, could not
      fail to buy from him what he called his idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dandy was thoughtful; he was preparing his batteries. Micheline, pale,
      and her eyes red for want of rest, was seated near the gallery, silently
      watching the sea, on which were passing, in the distance, fishing-smacks
      with their sails looking like white-winged birds. Madame Desvarennes was
      serious, and was giving Marechal instructions respecting her
      correspondence, while at the same time watching her daughter out of the
      corner of her eye. Micheline&rsquo;s depressed manner caused her some anxiety;
      she guessed some mystery. Still the young wife&rsquo;s trouble might be the
      result of last evening&rsquo;s serious interview. But the sagacity of the
      mistress guessed a new incident. Perhaps some scene between Serge and
      Micheline in regard to the club. She was on the watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol and Jeanne had gone for a drive to Mentone. With a single glance
      the Prince took in the attitude of one and all, and after a polite
      exchange of words and a careless kiss on Micheline&rsquo;s brow, he seated
      himself at table. The repast was silent. Each one seemed preoccupied.
      Serge anxiously asked himself whether Pierre had spoken. Marechal, deeply
      interested in his plate, answered briefly, when addressed by Madame
      Desvarennes. All the guests seemed constrained. It was a relief when they
      rose from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Micheline took her husband&rsquo;s arm and leading him into the garden, under
      the shade of the magnolias, said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother leaves us to-night. She has received a letter recalling her to
      Paris. Her journey here was, you no doubt know, on our account. Our
      absence made her sad, and she could no longer refrain from seeing me, so
      she came. On her return to Paris she will feel very lonely, and as I am so
      often alone&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Micheline!&rdquo; interrupted Serge, with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a reproach, dear,&rdquo; continued the young wife, sweetly. &ldquo;You have
      your engagements. There are necessities to which one must submit; you do
      what you think is expected of you, and it must be right. Only grant me a
      favor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A favor? To you?&rdquo; replied Serge, troubled at the unexpected turn the
      interview was taking. &ldquo;Speak, dear one; are you not at liberty to do as
      you like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Micheline, with a faint smile, &ldquo;as you are so kindly
      disposed, promise that we shall leave for Paris this week. The season is
      far advancing. All your friends will have returned. It will not be such a
      great sacrifice which I ask from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; said Serge, surprised at Micheline&rsquo;s sudden resolution. &ldquo;But,
      admit,&rdquo; added he, gravely, &ldquo;that your mother has worried you a little on
      the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother knows nothing of my project,&rdquo; returned the Princess, coldly. &ldquo;I
      did not care to say anything about it to her until I had your consent. A
      refusal on your part would have seemed too cruel. Already, you are not the
      best of friends, and it is one of my regrets. You must be good to my
      mother, Serge; she is getting old, and we owe her much gratitude and
      love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Panine remained silent. Could such a sudden change have come over
      Micheline in one day? She who lately sacrificed her mother for her husband
      now came and pleaded in favor of Madame Desvarennes. What had happened?
    </p>
    <p>
      He promptly decided on his course of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that you ask me shall be religiously fulfilled. No concession will be
      too difficult for me to make if it please you. You wish to return to
      Paris, we will go as soon as our arrangements have been made. Tell Madame
      Desvarennes, then, and let her see in our going a proof that I wish to
      live on good terms with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Micheline simply said: &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; And Serge having gallantly kissed her
      hand, she regained the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, Serge asked himself the meaning of the transformation in his
      wife. For the first time she had shown signs of taking the initiative. Had
      the question of money been raised by Madame Desvarennes, and was Micheline
      taking him back to Paris in the hope of inducing a change in his habits?
      They would see. The idea that Micheline had seen him with Jeanne never
      occurred to him. He did not think his wife capable of so much
      self-control. Loving as she was, she could not have controlled her
      feelings, and would have made a disturbance. Therefore he had no
      suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to their leaving for Paris he was delighted at the idea. Jeanne and
      Cayrol were leaving Nice at the end of the week. Lost in the vastness of
      the capital, the lovers would be more secure. They could see each other at
      leisure. Serge would hire a small house in the neighborhood of the Bois de
      Boulogne, and there they could enjoy each other&rsquo;s society without
      observation.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. CAYROL IS BLIND
    </h2>
    <p>
      Micheline, on her return to Paris, was a cause of anxiety to all her
      friends. Morally and physically she was changed. Her former gayety had
      disappeared. In a few weeks she became thin and seemed to be wasting away.
      Madame Desvarennes, deeply troubled, questioned her daughter, who
      answered, evasively, that she was perfectly well and had nothing to
      trouble her. The mother called in Doctor Rigaud, although she did not
      believe in the profession, and, after a long conference, took him to see
      Micheline. The doctor examined her, and declared it was nothing but
      debility. Madame Desvarennes was assailed with gloomy forebodings. She
      spent sleepless nights, during which she thought her daughter was dead;
      she heard the funeral dirges around her coffin. This strong woman wept,
      not daring to show her anxiety, and trembling lest Micheline should
      suspect her fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge was careless and happy, treating the apprehensions of those
      surrounding him with perfect indifference. He did not think his wife was
      ill&mdash;a little tired perhaps, or it might be change of climate,
      nothing serious. He had quite fallen into his old ways, spending every
      night at the club, and a part of the day in a little house in the Avenue
      Maillot, near the Bois de Boulogne. He had found one charmingly furnished,
      and there he sheltered his guilty happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was here that Jeanne came, thickly veiled, since her return from Nice.
      They each had a latchkey belonging to the door opening upon the Bois. The
      one who arrived first waited for the other, within the house, whose
      shutters remained closed to deceive passers-by. Then the hour of departure
      came; the hope of meeting again did not lessen their sadness at parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne seldom went to the Rue Saint-Dominique. The welcome that Micheline
      gave her was the same as usual, but Jeanne thought she discovered a
      coldness which made her feel uncomfortable; and she did not care to meet
      her lover&rsquo;s wife, so she made her visits scarce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol came every morning to talk on business matters with Madame
      Desvarennes. He had resumed the direction of his banking establishment.
      The great scheme of the European Credit Company had been launched by
      Herzog, and promised great results. Still Herzog caused Cayrol
      considerable anxiety. Although a man of remarkable intelligence, he had a
      great failing, and by trying to grasp too much often ended by
      accomplishing nothing. Scarcely was one scheme launched when another idea
      occurred to him, to which he sacrificed the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, Herzog was projecting a still grander scheme to be based on the
      European Credit. Cayrol, less sanguine, and more practical, was afraid of
      the new scheme, and when Herzog spoke to him about it, said that things
      were well enough for him as they were, and that he would not be implicated
      in any fresh financial venture however promising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol&rsquo;s refusal had vexed Herzog. The German knew what opinion he was
      held in by the public, and that without the prestige of Cayrol&rsquo;s name, and
      behind that, the house of Desvarennes, he would never have been able to
      float the European Credit as it had been. He was too cunning not to know
      this, and Cayrol having declined to join him, he looked round in search of
      a suitable person to inspire the shareholders with confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      His daughter often went to the Rue Saint-Dominique. Madame Desvarennes and
      Micheline had taken a fancy to her, as she was serious, natural, and
      homelike. They liked to see her, although her father was not congenial to
      their taste. Herzog had not succeeded in making friends with the mistress;
      she disliked and instinctively mistrusted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day it was rumored that Suzanne Herzog had gone in for an examination
      at the Hotel de Ville, and had gained a certificate: People thought it was
      very ridiculous. What was the good of so much learning for a girl who
      would have such a large fortune, and who would never know want. Savinien
      thought it was affectation and most laughable! Madame Desvarennes thought
      it was most interesting; she liked workers, and considered that the richer
      people were, the more reason they had to work. Herzog had allowed his
      daughter to please herself and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Springtime had come, and fine weather, yet Micheline&rsquo;s health did not
      improve. She did not suffer, but a sort of languor had come over her. For
      days she never quitted her reclining-chair. She was very affectionate
      toward her mother, and seemed to be making up for the lack of affection
      shown during the first months of her marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      She never questioned Serge as to his manner of spending his time, though
      she seldom saw him, except at meal hours. Every week she wrote to Pierre,
      who was buried in his mines, and after every despatch her mother noticed
      that she seemed sadder and paler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge and Jeanne grew bolder. They felt that they were not watched. The
      little house seemed too small for them, and they longed to go beyond the
      garden, as the air of the Bois was so sweet and scented with violets. A
      feeling of bravado came over them, and they did not mind being seen
      together. People would think they were a newly-married couple.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon they sallied forth, Jeanne wearing a thick veil, and
      trembling at the risk she was running, yet secretly delighted at going.
      They chose the most unfrequented paths and solitary nooks. Then, after an
      hour&rsquo;s stroll, they returned briskly, frightened at the sounds of
      carriages rolling in the distance. They often went out after that, and
      chose in preference the paths near the pond of Madrid where, behind
      sheltering shrubs, they sat talking and listening to the busy hum of
      Parisian life, seemingly so far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, about four o&rsquo;clock, Madame Desvarennes was going to Saint-Cloud
      on business, and was crossing the Bois de Boulogne. Her coachman had
      chosen the most unfrequented paths to save time. She had opened the
      carriage-window, and was enjoying the lovely scent from the shrubs.
      Suddenly a watering-cart stopped the way. Madame Desvarennes looked
      through the window to see what was the matter, and remained stupefied. At
      the turning of a path she espied Serge, with a woman on his arm. She
      uttered a cry that caused the couple to turn round. Seeing that pale face,
      they sought to hide themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment Madame Desvarennes was out of the carriage. The guilty couple
      fled down a path. Without caring what might be said of her, and goaded on
      by a fearful rage, she tried to follow them. She especially wished to see
      the woman who was closely veiled. She guessed her to be Jeanne. But the
      younger woman, terrified, fled like a deer down a side walk. Madame
      Desvarennes, quite out of breath, was obliged to stop. She heard the
      slamming of a carriage-door, and a hired brougham that had been waiting at
      the end of the path swept by her bearing the lovers toward the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mistress hesitated a moment, then said to her coachman:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive home.&rdquo; And, abandoning her business, she arrived in the Rue
      Saint-Dominique a few minutes after the Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a bound, without going through the offices, without even taking off
      her bonnet and cloak, she went up to Serge&rsquo;s apartments. Without
      hesitating, she entered the smoking-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Panine was there. Evidently he was expecting her. On seeing Madame
      Desvarennes he rose, with a smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can see that you are at home,&rdquo; said he, ironically; &ldquo;you come in
      without knocking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No nonsense; the moment is ill-chosen,&rdquo; briefly retorted the mistress.
      &ldquo;Why did you run away when you saw me a little while ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have such a singular way of accosting people,&rdquo; he answered, lightly.
      &ldquo;You come on like a charge of cavalry. The person with whom I was talking
      was frightened, she ran away and I followed her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was doing wrong then if she was frightened. Does she know me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who does not know you? You are almost notorious&mdash;in the
      corn-market!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes allowed the insult to pass without remark, and
      advancing toward Serge, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I introduce her to you?&rdquo; inquired the Prince, quietly. &ldquo;She is one
      of my countrywomen, a Polish&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a liar!&rdquo; cried Madame Desvarennes, unable to control her temper
      any longer. &ldquo;You are lying most impudently!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she was going to add, &ldquo;That woman was Jeanne!&rdquo; but prudence checked
      the sentence on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget yourself strangely, Madame,&rdquo; he said, in a dry tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot myself a year ago, not now! It was when I was weak that I forgot
      myself. When Micheline was between you and me I neither dared to speak nor
      act.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now, since after almost ruining my poor daughter, you deceive her, I
      have no longer any consideration for you. To make her come over to my side
      I have only to speak one word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, speak it! She is there. I will call her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes, in that supreme moment, was assailed by a doubt. What
      if Micheline, in her blind love, did not believe her?
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her hand to stop Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will not the fear of killing my daughter by this revelation stay you?&rdquo;
       asked she, bitterly. &ldquo;What manner of man are you to have so little heart
      and conscience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Panine burst into laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see what your threats are worth, and what value I place on them.
      Spare them in the future. You ask me what manner of man I am? I will tell
      you. I have not much patience, I hate to have my liberty interfered with,
      and I have a horror of family jars. I expect to be master of my own
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes was roused at these words. Her rage had abated on her
      daughter&rsquo;s account, but now it rose to a higher pitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! so this is it, is it?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You would like perfect liberty, I
      see! You make such very good use of it. You don&rsquo;t like to hear remarks
      upon it. It is more convenient, in fact! You wish to be master in your own
      house? In your own house! But, in truth, what are you here to put on airs
      toward me? Scarcely more than a servant. A husband receiving wages from
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge, with flashing eyes, made a terrible movement. He tried to speak,
      but his lips trembled, and he could not utter a sound. By a sign he showed
      Madame Desvarennes the door. The latter looked resolutely at the Prince,
      and with energy which nothing could henceforth soften, added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have to deal with me in future! Good-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, leaving the room with as much calmness as she felt rage when entering
      it, she went down to the counting-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol was sitting chatting with Marechal in his room. He was telling him
      that Herzog&rsquo;s rashness caused him much anxiety. Marechal did not encourage
      his confidence. The secretary&rsquo;s opinion on the want of morality on the
      part of the financier had strengthened. The good feeling he entertained
      toward the daughter had not counterbalanced the bad impression he had of
      the father, and he warmly advised Cayrol to break off all financial
      connection with such a man. Cayrol, indeed, had now very little to do with
      the European Credit. The office was still at his banking house, and the
      payments for shares were still made into his bank, but as soon as the new
      scheme which Herzog was preparing was launched, the financier intended
      settling in splendid offices which were being rapidly completed in the
      neighborhood of the Opera. Herzog might therefore commit all the follies
      which entered his head. Cayrol would be out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes entered. At the first glance, the men noticed the
      traces of the emotion she had just experienced. They rose and waited in
      silence. When the mistress was in a bad humor everybody gave way to her.
      It was the custom. She nodded to Cayrol, and walked up and down the
      office, absorbed in her own thoughts. Suddenly stopping, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marechal, prepare Prince Panine&rsquo;s account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The secretary looked up amazed, and did not seem to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! The Prince has had an overdraft; you will give me a statement;
      that&rsquo;s all! I wish to see how we two stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men, astonished to hear Madame Desvarennes speak of her son-in-law
      as she would of a customer, exchanged looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have lent my son-in-law money, Cayrol?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as the banker remained silent, still looking at the secretary, Madame
      added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the presence of Marechal make you hesitate in answering me? Speak
      before him; I have told you more than a hundred times that he knows my
      business as well as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, indeed, advanced some money to the Prince,&rdquo; replied Cayrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much?&rdquo; inquired Madame Desvarennes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember the exact amount. I was happy to oblige your
      son-in-law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were wrong, and have acted unwisely in not acquainting me of the
      fact. It is thus that his follies have been encouraged by obliging
      friends. At all events, I ask you now not to lend him any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol seemed put out, and, with his hands in his pockets and his
      shoulders up, replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a delicate matter which you ask of me. You will cause a quarrel
      between the Prince and myself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you prefer quarreling with me?&rdquo; asked the mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zounds! No!&rdquo; replied the banker. &ldquo;But you place me in an embarrassing
      position! I have just promised to lend Serge a considerable sum to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! you will not give it to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is an act which he will scarcely forgive,&rdquo; sighed Cayrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes placed her hand on the shoulder of the banker, and
      looking seriously at him, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not have forgiven me if I had allowed you to render him this
      service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A vague uneasiness filled Cayrol&rsquo;s heart, a shadow seemed to pass before
      his eyes, and in a troubled voice he said to the mistress:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he would have repaid you badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol thought the mistress was alluding to the money he had already lent,
      and his fears vanished. Madame Desvarennes would surely repay it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are cutting off his resources?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Completely,&rdquo; answered the mistress. &ldquo;He takes too much liberty, that
      young gentleman. He was wrong to forget that I hold the purse-strings. I
      don&rsquo;t mind paying, but I want a little deference shown me for my money.
      Good-by! Cayrol, remember my instructions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, shaking hands with the banker, Madame Desvarennes entered her own
      office, leaving the two men together.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment&rsquo;s pause: Cayrol was the first to break the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of the Prince&rsquo;s position?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His financial position?&rdquo; asked Marechal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! I know all about that! I mean his relation to Madame
      Desvarennes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zounds! If we were in Venice in the days of the Aqua-Toffana, the sbirri
      and the bravi&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What rubbish!&rdquo; interrupted Cayrol, shrugging his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me continue,&rdquo; said the secretary, &ldquo;and you can shrug your shoulders
      afterward if you like. If we had been in Venice, knowing Madame
      Desvarennes as I do, it would not have been surprising to me to have had
      Master Serge found at the bottom of the canal some fine morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not in earnest,&rdquo; muttered the banker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much more so than you think. Only you know we live in the nineteenth
      century, and we cannot make Providence interpose in the form of a dagger
      or poison so easily as in former days. Arsenic and verdigris are sometimes
      used, but it does not answer. Scientific people have had the meanness to
      invent tests by which poison can be detected even when there is none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are making fun of me,&rdquo; said Cayrol, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I! No. Come, do you wish to do a good stroke of business? Find a man who
      will consent to rid Madame Desvarennes of her son-in-law. If he succeed,
      ask Madame Desvarennes for a million francs. I will pay it at only
      twenty-five francs&rsquo; discount, if you like!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol was thoughtful. Marechal continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have known the house a long time, how is it you don&rsquo;t understand the
      mistress better? I tell you, and remember this: between Madame Desvarennes
      and the Prince there is a mortal hatred. One of the two will destroy the
      other. Which? Betting is open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what must I do? The Prince relies on me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and tell him not to do so any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, no! I would rather he came to my office. I should be more at ease.
      Adieu, Marechal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adieu, Monsieur Cayrol. But on whom will you bet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I venture I should like to know on whose side the Princess is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, dangler! You think too much of the women! Some day you will be let in
      through that failing of yours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol smiled conceitedly, and went away. Marechal sat down at his desk,
      and took out a sheet of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must tell Pierre that everything is going on well here,&rdquo; he murmured.
      &ldquo;If he knew what was taking place he would soon be back, and might be
      guilty of some foolery or other.&rdquo; So he commenced writing.

      CHAPTER XVIII. THE UNIVERSAL CREDIT COMPANY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The banking-house of Cayrol had not a very imposing appearance. It was a
      narrow two-storied building, the front blackened by time. There was a
      carriage gateway, on the right-hand side of which was the entrance to the
      offices. The stairs leading to the first floor were covered by a well-worn
      carpet. Here was a long corridor into which the different offices opened.
      On their glass doors might be read: &ldquo;Payments of dividends.&rdquo; &ldquo;Accounts.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Foreign correspondence.&rdquo; &ldquo;General office.&rdquo; Cayrol&rsquo;s own room was quite at
      the end, and communicated with his private apartments. Everything breathed
      of simplicity and honesty. Cayrol had never tried to throw dust into
      people&rsquo;s eyes. He had started modestly when opening the bank; his business
      had increased, but his habits had remained the same. It was not a
      difficult matter to obtain an interview, even by people not known to him.
      They sent in their cards, and were admitted to his sanctum.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was amid the coming and going of customers and clerks that Prince
      Panine came the following day to find Cayrol. For the first time Serge had
      put himself out for the banker. He was introduced with marks of the most
      profound respect. The great name of Desvarennes seemed to cast a kind of
      halo round his head in the eyes of the clerks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol, a little embarrassed, but still resolute, went toward him. Serge
      seemed nervous and somewhat abrupt in manner. He foresaw some difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! my dear fellow,&rdquo; he said, without sitting down. &ldquo;What are you up
      to? I have waited since yesterday for the money you promised me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol scratched his ear, and felt taken aback by this plain speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is&mdash;&rdquo; stammered he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you forgotten your engagement?&rdquo; asked Serge, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Cayrol, speaking slowly, &ldquo;but I met Madame Desvarennes
      yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what had that to do with your intentions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zounds! It had everything to do with them. Your mother-in-law made a
      scene, and forbade my lending you any money. You must understand, my dear
      Prince, that my relations with Madame Desvarennes are important. I hold a
      great deal of money of hers in my bank. She first gave me a start. I
      cannot, without appearing ungrateful, act contrary to her will. Place
      yourself in my position, and judge impartially of the terrible alternative
      between obliging you and displeasing my benefactress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry; it is useless,&rdquo; said Serge, with a scornful laugh. &ldquo;I
      sympathize with your troubles. You side with the money-bags. It remains to
      be seen whether you will gain by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Prince, I swear to you that I am in despair,&rdquo; cried Cayrol,
      annoyed at the turn the interview was taking. &ldquo;Listen; be reasonable! I
      don&rsquo;t know what you have done to your mother-in-law, but she seems much
      vexed with you. In your place I would rather make a few advances than
      remain hostile toward Madame Desvarennes. That would mend matters, you
      see. Flies are not to be caught with vinegar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge looked contemptuously at Cayrol, and put on his hat with supreme
      insolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, my dear fellow; as a banker you are excellent when you have
      any money to spare, but as a moralist you are highly ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, turning on his heel, he quitted the office, leaving Cayrol quite
      abashed. He passed along the corridor switching his cane with suppressed
      rage. Madame Desvarennes had, with one word, dried up the source from
      which he had been drawing most of the money which he had spent during the
      last three months. He had to pay a large sum that evening at the club, and
      he did not care to apply to the money-lenders of Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went down the stairs wondering how he would get out of this scrape! Go
      to Madame Desvarennes and humble himself as Cayrol advised? Never! He
      regretted, for a moment, the follies which had led him into this
      difficulty. He ought to have been able to live on two hundred thousand
      francs a year! He had squandered money foolishly, and now the
      inexhaustible well from which he had drawn his treasure was closed by an
      invincible will.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was crossing the gateway, when a well-known voice struck his ear, and
      he turned round. Herzog, smiling in his enigmatical manner, was before
      him. Serge bowed, and wanted to pass on, but the financier put his hand on
      his arm, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a hurry you are in, Prince. I suppose your pocketbook is full of
      notes, and you are afraid of being plundered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with his finger, Herzog touched the silver mounted pocketbook, the
      corner of which was peeping out of the Prince&rsquo;s pocket. Panine could not
      control a gesture of vexation, which made the financier smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I wrong?&rdquo; asked Herzog. &ldquo;Can our friend Cayrol have refused your
      request? By-the-bye, did you not quarrel with Madame Desvarennes
      yesterday? Whoever was it told me that? Your mother-in-law spoke of
      cutting off all your credit, and from your downcast look I guess that fool
      Cayrol has obeyed the orders he has received.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge, exasperated and stamping with rage, wanted to speak, but it was no
      easy matter interrupting Herzog. Besides, there was something in the
      latter&rsquo;s look which annoyed Serge. His glance seemed to be fathoming the
      depths of Panine&rsquo;s pockets, and the latter instinctively tightened his
      arms across his chest, so that Herzog might not see that his pocketbook
      was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; asked Serge, at last, with a constrained
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About things which must greatly interest you,&rdquo; said Herzog, familiarly.
      &ldquo;Come, be sincere. Cayrol has just refused you a sum of money. He&rsquo;s a
      simpleton! How much do you want? Will a hundred thousand francs do just
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And writing a few words on a check, the financier handed it to Serge,
      adding:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man of your position should not be in any difficulty for such a paltry
      sum!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; said Serge, astonished, and pushing away Herzog&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accept it, and don&rsquo;t feel indebted to me. It is hardly worth while
      between you and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And taking Panine&rsquo;s arm Herzog walked on with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your carriage is there? all right, mine will follow. I want to talk to
      you. Your troubles cannot last. I will show you the means of extricating
      yourself and that without delay, my dear sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And without consulting Panine he seated himself beside him in the
      carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you once, if you remember,&rdquo; continued the financier, &ldquo;that I might
      prove useful to you. You were haughty, and I did not insist; yet you see
      the day has come. Let me speak frankly with you. It is my usual manner,
      and there is some good in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; answered Serge, rather puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You find yourself at this moment, vulgarly speaking, left in the lurch.
      Your wants are many and your resources few.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least&mdash;&rdquo; protested Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! There you are refractory,&rdquo; said the financier, laughingly, &ldquo;and I
      have not finished. The day after your marriage you formed your household
      on a lavish footing; you gave splendid receptions; you bought race-horses;
      in short, you went the pace like a great lord. Undoubtedly it costs a lot
      of money to keep up such an establishment. As you spent without counting
      the cost, you confounded the capital with the interest, so that at this
      moment you are three parts ruined. I don&rsquo;t think you would care to change
      your mode of living, and it is too late in the day to cut down expenses
      and exist on what remains? No. Well, to keep up your present style you
      need at least a million francs every year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You calculate like Cocker,&rdquo; remarked Serge, smiling with some constraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my business,&rdquo; answered Herzog. &ldquo;There are two ways by which you
      can obtain that million. The first is by making it up with your
      mother-in-law, and consenting, for money, to live under her dominion. I
      know her, she will agree to this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Serge, &ldquo;I refuse to submit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case you must get out of your difficulties alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how?&rdquo; inquired the Prince, with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herzog looked at him seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By entering on the path which I am ready to open up to you,&rdquo; replied
      Herzog, &ldquo;and in which I will guide you. By going in for business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge returned Herzog&rsquo;s glance and tried to read his face, but found him
      impenetrable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To go into business one needs experience, and I have none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine will suffice,&rdquo; retorted the financier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or money,&rdquo; continued the Prince, &ldquo;and I have none, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask money from you. I offer you some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then, do I bring into the concern?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prestige of your name, and your relations with Madame Desvarennes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince answered, haughtily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My relations are personal, and I doubt whether they will serve you. My
      mother-in-law is hostile, and will do nothing for me. As to my name, it
      does not belong to me, it belongs to those who bore it nobly before me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your relations will serve me,&rdquo; said Herzog. &ldquo;I am satisfied. Your
      mother-in-law cannot get out of your being her daughter&rsquo;s husband, and for
      that you are worth your weight in gold. As to your name, it is just
      because it has been nobly borne that it is valuable. Thank your ancestors,
      therefore, and make the best of the only heritage they left you. Besides,
      if you care to examine things closely, your ancestors will not have reason
      to tremble in their graves. What did they do formerly? They imposed taxes
      on their vassals and extorted money from the vanquished. We financiers do
      the same. Our vanquished are the speculators; our vassals the
      shareholders. And what a superiority there is about our proceedings! There
      is no violence. We persuade; we fascinate; and the money flows into our
      coffers. What do I say? They beseech us to take it. We reign without
      contest. We are princes, too princes of finance. We have founded an
      aristocracy as proud and as powerful as the old one. Feudality of nobility
      no longer exists; it has given way to that of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge laughed. He saw what Herzog was driving at.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your great barons of finance are sometimes subject to executions,&rdquo; said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were not Chalais, Cinq-Mars, Biron, and Montmorency executed?&rdquo; asked
      Herzog, with irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was on a scaffold,&rdquo; replied Panine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! the speculator&rsquo;s scaffold is the Bourse! But only small dabblers in
      money succumb; the great ones are safe from danger. They are supported in
      their undertakings by such powerful and numerous interests that they
      cannot fail without involving public credit; even governments are forced
      to come to their aid. One of these powerful and indestructible enterprises
      I have dreamed of grafting on to the European Credit Company, the
      Universal Credit Company. Its very name is a programme in itself. To
      stretch over the four quarters of the globe like an immense net, and draw
      into its meshes all financial speculators: such is its aim. Nobody will be
      able to withstand us. I am offering you great things, but I dream of still
      greater. I have ideas. You will see them developed, and will profit by
      them, if you join my fortunes. You are ambitious, Prince. I guessed it;
      but your ambition hitherto has been satisfied with small things&mdash;luxurious
      indulgences and triumphs of elegance! What are these worth to what I can
      give you? The sphere in which you move is narrow. I will make it immense.
      You will no longer reign over a small social circle, you will rule a
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge, more affected than he cared to show, tried to banter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you repeating the prologue to Faust?&rdquo; asked he. &ldquo;Where is your
      magical compact? Must I sign it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. Your consent is sufficient. Look into the business, study it
      at your leisure, and measure the results; and then if it suit you, you can
      sign a deed of partnership. Then in a few years you may possess a fortune
      surpassing all that you have dreamed of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The financier remained silent. Serge was weighing the question. Herzog was
      happy; he had shown himself to all Paris in company with Madame
      Desvarennes&rsquo;s son-in-law. He had already realized one of his projects. The
      carriage was just passing down the Champs Elysees. The weather was lovely,
      and in the distance could be seen the trees of the Tuileries and the
      different monuments of the Place de la Concorde bathed in blue mist.
      Groups of horsemen were cantering along the side avenues. Long files of
      carriages were rolling rapidly by with well-dressed ladies. The capital
      displayed at that hour all the splendor of its luxury. It was Paris in all
      its strength and gayety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herzog stretched out his hand, and calling the Prince&rsquo;s attention to the
      sight, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s your empire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, looking at him earnestly, he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it agreed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge hesitated for a moment, and then bowed his head, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is agreed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herzog pulled the check-string communicating with the coachman and
      alighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; said he to Panine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slipped into his own carriage, which had followed closely behind, and
      drove off.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that day, even Jeanne had a rival. The fever of speculation had
      seized on Serge; he had placed his little finger within the wheels and he
      must follow&mdash;body, name, and soul. The power which this new game
      exercised over him was incredible. It was quite different to the stupid
      games at the club, always the same. On the Bourse, everything was new,
      unexpected, sudden, and formidable. The intensity of the feelings were
      increased a hundredfold, owing to the importance of the sums risked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was really a splendid sight to see Herzog manipulating matters,
      maneuvering with a miraculous dexterity millions of francs. And then the
      field for operations was large. Politics, the interests of nations, were
      the mainsprings which impelled the play, and the game assumed diplomatic
      vastness and financial grandeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his private office Herzog issued orders, and whether his ability was
      really extraordinary, or whether fortune exceptionally favored him,
      success was certain. Serge, from the first week, realized considerable
      sums. This brilliant success threw him in a state of great excitement. He
      believed everything that Herzog said to him as if it were gospel. He saw
      the world bending under the yoke which he was about to impose upon it.
      People working and toiling every day were doing so for him alone, and like
      one of those kings who had conquered the world, he pictured all the
      treasures of the earth laid at his feet. From that time he lost the sense
      of right and wrong. He admitted the unlikely, and found the impossible
      quite natural. He was a docile tool in the hands of Herzog.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rumor of this unforeseen change in Panine&rsquo;s circumstances soon reached
      Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s ears. The mistress was frightened, and sent for
      Cayrol, begging him to remain a director of the European Credit, in order
      to watch the progress of the new affair. With her practical common sense,
      she foresaw disasters, and even regretted that Serge had not confined
      himself to cards and reckless living.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol was most uneasy, and made a confidant of his wife, who, deeply
      troubled, told Panine the fears his friends entertained on his account.
      The Prince smiled disdainfully, saying these fears were the effect of
      plebeian timidity. The mistress understood nothing of great speculations,
      and Cayrol was a narrow-minded banker! He knew what he was doing. The
      results of his speculations were mathematical. So far they had not
      disappointed his hopes. The great Universal Credit Company, of which he
      was going to be a director, would bring him in such an immense fortune
      that he would be independent of Madame Desvarennes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne, terrified at this blind confidence, tried to persuade him. Serge
      took her in his arms, kissed her, and banished her fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes had forbidden her people to tell Micheline anything of
      what was going on, as she wished her to remain in perfect ignorance. By a
      word, the mistress, if she could not have prevented the follies of which
      Serge was guilty, could, at least, have spared herself and her daughter.
      It would have only been necessary to reveal his behavior and betrayal to
      Micheline, and to provoke a separation. If the house of Desvarennes were
      no longer security for Panine, his credit would fall. Disowned by his
      mother-in-law, and publicly given up by her, he would be of no use to
      Herzog, and would be promptly thrown over by him. The mistress did not
      wish her daughter to know the heartrending truth. She would not willingly
      cause her to shed tears, and therefore preferred risking ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Micheline, too, tried to hide her troubles from her mother. She knew too
      well that Serge would have the worst of it if he got into her black books.
      With the incredible persistence of a loving heart, she hoped to win back
      Serge. Thus a terrible misunderstanding caused these two women to remain
      inactive and silent, when, by united efforts, they might, perhaps, have
      prevented dangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great speculation was already being talked about. Herzog was boldly
      placing his foot on the summit whereon the five or six demigods, who ruled
      the stock market, were firmly placed. The audacious encroachments of this
      newcomer had vexed these formidable potentates, and already they had
      decided secretly his downfall because he would not let them share in his
      profits.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, the Parisians, on awakening, found the walls placarded with
      notices advertising the issue of shares in the Universal Credit Company,
      and announcing the names of the directors, among which appeared that of
      the Prince. Some were members of the Legion d&rsquo;Honneur; others recent
      members of the Cabinet Council, and Prefets retired into private life. A
      list of names to dazzle the public, but all having a weak point.
    </p>
    <p>
      This created a great sensation in the business world. Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s
      son-in-law was on the board. It was a good speculation, then? People
      consulted the mistress, who found herself somewhat in a dilemma; either
      she must disown her son-in-law, or speak well of the affair. Still she did
      not hesitate, for she was loyal and honest above all things. She declared
      the speculation was a poor one, and did all she could to prevent any of
      her friends becoming shareholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The issue of shares was disastrous. The great banks remained hostile, and
      capitalists were mistrustful. Herzog landed a few million francs.
      Doorkeepers and cooks brought him their savings. He covered expenses. But
      it was no use advertising and puffing in the newspapers, as a word had
      gone forth which paralyzed the speculation. Ugly rumors were afloat.
      Herzog&rsquo;s German origin was made use of by the bankers, who whispered that
      the aim of the Universal Credit Company was exclusively political. It was
      to establish branch banks in every part of the world to further the
      interests of German industry. Further, at a given moment, Germany might
      have need of a loan in case of war, and the Universal Credit Company would
      be there to supply the necessary aid to the great military nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herzog was not a man to be put down without resisting, and he made supreme
      efforts to float his undertaking. He caused a number of unissued shares to
      be sold on &lsquo;Change, and had them bought up by his own men, thus creating a
      fictitious interest in the company. In a few days the shares rose and were
      at a premium, simply through the jobbery to which Herzog lent himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Panine was little disposed to seek for explanations, and, besides, had
      such unbounded faith in his partner that he suspected nothing. He remained
      in perfect tranquillity. He had increased his expenditure, and his
      household was on a royal footing. Micheline&rsquo;s sweetness emboldened him; he
      no longer took the trouble of dissimulating, and treated his young wife
      with perfect indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne and Serge met every day at the little house in the Avenue Maillot.
      Cayrol was too much engaged with the new anxieties which Herzog caused
      him, to look after his wife, and left her quite free to amuse herself.
      Besides, he had not the least suspicion. Jeanne, like all guilty women,
      overwhelmed him with kind attentions, which the good man mistook for
      proofs of love. The fatal passion was growing daily stronger in the young
      woman&rsquo;s heart, and she would have found it impossible to have given up her
      dishonorable happiness with Panine. She felt herself capable of doing
      anything to preserve her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne had already said, &ldquo;Oh! if we were but free!&rdquo; And they formed
      projects. They would go away to Lake Lugano, and, in a villa hidden by
      trees and shrubs, would enjoy the pleasures of being indissolubly united.
      The woman was more eager than the man in giving way to these visions of
      happiness. She sometimes said, &ldquo;What hinders us now? Let us go.&rdquo; But
      Serge, prudent and discreet, even in the most affectionate moments, led
      Jeanne to take a more sensible view. What was the use of a scandal? Did
      they not belong to each other?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the young woman reproached him for not loving her as much as she
      loved him. She was tired of dissimulating; her husband was an object of
      horror to her, and she had to tell him untruths and submit to his caresses
      which were revolting to her. Serge calmed her with a kiss, and bade her
      wait awhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre, rendered anxious on hearing that Serge had joined Herzog in his
      dangerous financial speculations, had left his mines and had just arrived.
      The letters which Micheline addressed to the friend of her youth, her
      enforced confidant in trouble, were calm and resigned. Full of pride, she
      had carefully hidden from Pierre the cause of her troubles. He was the
      last person by whom she would like to be pitied, and her letters had
      represented Serge as repentant and full of good feeling. Marechal, for
      similar reasons, had kept his friend in the dark. He feared Pierre&rsquo;s
      interference, and he wished to spare Madame Desvarennes the grief of
      seeing her adopted son quarreling with her son-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the placards announcing the establishment of the Universal Credit
      Company made their way into the provinces, and one morning Pierre found
      some stuck on the walls of his establishment. Seeing the name of Panine,
      and not that of Cayrol, Pierre shuddered. The unpleasant ideas which he
      experienced formerly when Herzog was introduced to the Desvarennes
      recurred to his mind. He wrote to the mistress to ask what was going on,
      and not receiving an answer, he started off without hesitation for Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Madame Desvarennes in a terrible state of excitement. The shares
      had just fallen a hundred and twenty francs. A panic had ensued. The
      affair was considered as absolutely lost, and the shareholders were
      aggravating matters by wanting to sell out at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Savinien was just coming away from the mistress&rsquo;s room. He wanted to see
      the downfall of the Prince, whom he had always hated, looking upon him as
      a usurper of his own rights upon the fortune of the Desvarennes. He began
      lamenting to his aunt, when she turned upon him with unusual harshness,
      and he felt bound as he said, laughing, to leave the &ldquo;funereal mansion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol, as much interested in the affairs of the Prince as if they were
      his own, went backward and forward between the Rue Saint-Dominique and the
      Rue Taitbout, pale and troubled, but without losing his head. He had
      already saved the European Credit Company by separating it six weeks
      before from the Universal Credit Company, notwithstanding Madame
      Desvarennes&rsquo;s supplications to keep them together, in the hope that the
      one would save the other. But Cayrol, practical, clear, and implacable,
      had refused, for the first time, to obey Madame Desvarennes. He acted with
      the resolution of a captain of a vessel, who throws overboard a portion of
      the cargo to save the ship, the crew, and the rest of the merchandise. He
      did well, and the European Credit was safe. The shares had fallen a
      little, but a favorable reaction was already showing itself. The name of
      Cayrol, and his presence at the head of affairs, had reassured the public,
      and the shareholders gathered round him, passing a vote of confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The banker, devoted to his task, next sought to save Panine, who was at
      that very moment robbing him of his honor and happiness in the house of
      the Avenue Maillot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre, Cayrol, and Madame Desvarennes met in Marechal&rsquo;s private office.
      Pierre declared that it was imperative to take strong measures and to
      speak to the Prince. It was the duty of the mistress to enlighten Panine,
      who was no doubt Herzog&rsquo;s dupe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes shook her head sadly. She feared that Serge was not a
      dupe but an accomplice. And what could she tell him? Let him ruin himself!
      He would not believe her. She knew how he received her advice and bore her
      remonstrances.
    </p>
    <p>
      An explanation between her and Serge was impossible, and her interference
      would only hurry him into the abyss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I will speak to him,&rdquo; said Pierre, resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Madame Desvarennes, &ldquo;not you! Only one here can tell him
      efficaciously what he must hear, and that is Cayrol. Let us above all
      things keep guard over our words and our behavior. On no account must
      Micheline suspect anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus, at the most solemn moments, when fortune and honor, perhaps, were
      compromised, the mother thought of her daughter&rsquo;s welfare and happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol went up to the Prince&rsquo;s rooms. He had just come in, and was opening
      his letters, while having a cigarette in the smoking-room. A door, covered
      by curtains, led to a back stair which opened into the courtyard. Cayrol
      had gone up that way, feeling sure that by so doing he would not meet
      Micheline.
    </p>
    <p>
      On seeing Jeanne&rsquo;s husband, Serge rose quickly. He feared that Cayrol had
      discovered everything, and instinctively stepped backward. The banker&rsquo;s
      manner soon undeceived him. He was serious, but not in a rage. He had
      evidently come on business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear Cayrol,&rdquo; said the Prince, gayly, &ldquo;what good fortune has
      brought you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is fortune, it is certainly not good fortune,&rdquo; answered the banker,
      gravely. &ldquo;I wish to have some talk with you, and I shall be grateful if
      you will listen patiently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo; said Serge. &ldquo;How serious you are. You have some heavy payments
      on hand, and want a little help, eh? I will speak to Herzog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol looked at the Prince in amazement. So he did not suspect anything?
      Such carelessness and negligence frightened him. The banker resolved to
      proceed clearly, and without beating about the bush; to do away with such
      blind confidence a thunderbolt was necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not come about my business, but yours,&rdquo; returned Cayrol. &ldquo;The
      Universal Credit Company is on the eve of disaster; there is still time
      for you to withdraw safely and soundly from the sinking wreck. I bring you
      the means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Cayrol; you are very kind, my friend. I know your intentions
      are good, but I don&rsquo;t believe a word you are saying. You have come from
      Madame Desvarennes. You are both agreed that I shall give up the Universal
      Credit, but I will not yield to any pressure. I know what I am doing. Be
      easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And quietly lighting another cigarette, he gracefully puffed the smoke
      toward the ceiling. Cayrol did not trouble to argue, but took a newspaper
      from his pocket and handed it to Panine, simply saying, &ldquo;Read!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was an article in a reliable financial paper prophesying the failure of
      the Universal Credit Company, and basing its statements on irrefutable
      calculations. Serge took the paper and looked over it. He turned pale and
      crushed it in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What infamy!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;I know our adversaries are enraged. Yes, they
      know that our new company is destined to crush them in the future, and
      they are doing all they can to run us aground. Jealousy! Envy! There is no
      other foundation for these rumors, and they are unworthy a serious man&rsquo;s
      attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is neither envy nor jealousy. All is true,&rdquo; said Cayrol. &ldquo;You will
      admit that I am your sincere friend? Well, I swear to you that the
      situation is terrible, and you must resign your directorship of the
      Universal Credit without loss of time. There&rsquo;s not a moment to lose. Sit
      down and write your resignation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I am a child to be led by the nose like that?&rdquo; asked the
      Prince, in a passion. &ldquo;If you are sincere, Cayrol, as I wish to believe, I
      also think you are a fool. You don&rsquo;t understand! As to drawing out of the
      company, never! I have a lot of money invested in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, lose your money, Madame Desvarennes will pay you back. At least you
      can save your name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I see you are conniving with her!&rdquo; exclaimed the Prince, loudly.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me another word, I don&rsquo;t believe you. I shall go straight to
      the office, and I will speak to Herzog. We will take measures to prosecute
      the papers for libel if they dare to publish these untruths.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol saw that nothing would convince Panine. He hoped that an interview
      with Herzog would enlighten him. He left the matter to chance, as
      reasoning was of no avail, and went down to the mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge drove to the Universal Credit Company. It was the first day in the
      new offices. Herzog had furnished them splendidly, thinking that this
      would give the shareholders a high opinion of the undertaking. How could
      they have any doubts when they saw such splendid furniture and large
      offices? How could they refuse to place their money in the hands of
      speculators that could cover their floors with such soft carpets? The
      porters, with their dark blue and red cloth liveries, and buttons with the
      company&rsquo;s monogram on them, answered inquiries with haughty condescension.
      Everything foretold success. It was in the air. You could hear the cashier
      shovelling heaps of gold. The people who had placed the Universal Credit
      Company on such a footing were either very powerful or very impudent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge walked in, as he would have done at home, with his hat on, amid a
      number of small shareholders, who had come full of anxiety after reading
      the accounts in the newspapers, and who felt full of confidence after
      seeing the splendor of the place. Panine reached Herzog&rsquo;s office, but when
      about to open the door, loud voices struck his ear. The financier was
      arguing with a director, and Panine listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The speculation is safe and sure,&rdquo; Herzog was saying. &ldquo;The shares are
      low, I know, because I have ceased to keep them up. I have given orders in
      London, Vienna, and Berlin, and we are buying up all shares that are
      offered in the market. I shall then run the shares up again, and we shall
      realize an enormous sum. It is most simple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is shady,&rdquo; said the other voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? I defend myself as I am attacked. The great banks seek to
      deteriorate my stock. I buy in, and take it out of my adversaries. Is it
      not just and lawful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Panine breathed freely and felt reassured. The depreciation was caused by
      Herzog; he had just said so. There was nothing to fear then. It was just a
      trick of Herzog&rsquo;s, and the company would come out brighter than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! here&rsquo;s Prince Panine,&rdquo; said Herzog. &ldquo;Ask him what he thinks of the
      matter. I defer to his judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know anything,&rdquo; said Serge. &ldquo;I have full confidence in
      you, my dear manager, and our business will prosper in your hands, I am
      sure. Besides, I know the manoeuvres of our opponents, and I think every
      financial means justifiable to answer them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! What did I say to you a few minutes ago?&rdquo; cried Herzog, addressing
      his questioner in a tone of triumph. &ldquo;Let me act and you will see.
      Besides, I don&rsquo;t want to keep you against your will,&rdquo; he added, harshly.
      &ldquo;You are at liberty to withdraw from us if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other protested that what he had said was for the best interests of
      all concerned. He did not dream of leaving the company; on the contrary,
      they might rely on him. He appreciated the experience and ability of
      Herzog too well to separate his fortune from his friend&rsquo;s. And, shaking
      hands with the financier, he took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! What is all this clamor in the newspapers?&rdquo; asked Serge, when he
      found himself alone with Herzog. &ldquo;Do you know that the articles published
      are very perfidious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the more perfidious because they are founded on truth,&rdquo; said the
      financier, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; cried Serge, in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth. Do you think I am to tell you lies as I did to that idiot who
      has just gone out? The Universal Credit has at this moment a screw loose.
      But patience! I have an idea, and in a fortnight the shares will have
      doubled in value. I have a splendid scheme in hand which will kill the gas
      companies. It is a plan for lighting by magnesium. Its effect will be
      startling. I shall publish sensational articles describing the invention
      in the London and Brussels papers. Gas shares will fall very low. I shall
      buy up all I can, and when I am master of the situation, I shall announce
      that the threatened gas companies are buying up the invention. Shares will
      rise again, and I shall realize a goodly sum, which will be for the
      benefit of the Universal Credit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for such a formidable speculation foreign agents will require
      security?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will offer it to them. I have here ten million francs&rsquo; worth of shares
      in the European Credit belonging to Cayrol. We will give the cashier a
      joint receipt for them. The speculation will last three days. It is safe,
      and when the result is achieved we will replace the shares, and take back
      the receipt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; asked Serge, &ldquo;is this plan of taking the shares which don&rsquo;t belong
      to us legal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a transfer,&rdquo; said Herzog, with simplicity. &ldquo;Besides, don&rsquo;t forget
      that we have to do with Cayrol, that is to say with a partner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we tell him of it,&rdquo; insisted the Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! The deuce! We should have to explain everything to him. He knows
      what&rsquo;s what, and would find the idea too good, and want a share of the
      spoil. No! Sign that, and don&rsquo;t be alarmed. The sheep will be back in the
      fold before the shepherd comes to count them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A dark presentiment crossed Serge&rsquo;s mind, and he was afraid. At that
      moment, when his fate was being decided, he hesitated to go deeper into
      the rut where he had already been walking too long. He stood silent and
      undecided. Confused thoughts crowded his brain; his temples throbbed, and
      a buzzing noise sounded in his ears. But the thought of giving up his
      liberty, and again subjecting himself to Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s protection
      was like the lash of a whip, and he blushed for having hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herzog looked at him, and, smiling in a constrained way, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, too, may give up the affair if you like. If I share it with you it
      is because you are so closely allied to me. I don&rsquo;t so very much care to
      cut the pear in two. Don&rsquo;t think that I am begging of you to be my
      partner! Do as you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge caught hold of the paper and, having signed it, handed it to the
      financier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Herzog. &ldquo;I shall leave to-night and be absent three
      days. Watch the money market. You will see the results of my
      calculations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And shaking hands with the Prince, Herzog went to the cashier to get the
      scrip and deposit the receipt.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. SIN GROWS BOLDER
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was a party at Cayrol&rsquo;s. In the drawing-rooms of the mansion in the
      Rue Taitbout everything was resplendent with lights, and there was quite a
      profusion of flowers. Cayrol had thought of postponing the party, but was
      afraid of rousing anxieties, and like an actor who, though he has just
      lost his father, must play the following day, so Cayrol gave his party and
      showed a smiling face, so as to prevent harm to his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matters had taken a turn for the worse during the last three days. The
      bold stroke, to carry out which Herzog had gone to London so as to be more
      secret, had been got wind of. The fall of the shares had not taken place.
      Working with considerable sums of money, the loss on the difference was as
      great as the gains would have been. The shares belonging to the European
      Credit Company had defrayed the cost of the game. It was a disaster.
      Cayrol, in his anxiety, had applied for the scrip and had only found the
      receipt given to the cashier. Although the transaction was most irregular,
      Cayrol had not said anything; but, utterly cast down, had gone to Madame
      Desvarennes to tell her of the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince was in bed, pretending to be ill. His wife, happily ignorant of
      all that was going on, rejoiced secretly at his indisposition because she
      was allowed to nurse him and have him all to herself. Panine, alarmed at
      the check they had experienced, was expecting Herzog with feverish
      impatience, and to keep out of sight had chosen the privacy of his own
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, Cayrol had been allowed to see him, and with great circumspection
      told him that his non-appearance at the same time that Herzog was absent
      was most fatal for the Universal Credit Company. It was absolutely
      necessary that he should be seen in public. He must come to his party, and
      appear with a calm face. Serge promised to come, and had imposed on
      Micheline the heavy task of accompanying him to Jeanne&rsquo;s. It was the first
      time since her return from Nice that she had entered the house of her
      husband&rsquo;s mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The concert was over, and a crowd of guests were coming from the large
      drawing-room to the boudoir and little drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The symphony is over. Ouf!&rdquo; said Savinien, yawning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like music?&rdquo; asked Marechal, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, military music. But two hours of Schumann and Mendelssohn at high
      pressure is too much for one man. But I say, Marechal, what do you think
      of Mademoiselle Herzog&rsquo;s being at Cayrol&rsquo;s soiree. It is a little too
      strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the father has bolted, and the daughter is preparing a dance. Each
      has a different way of using their feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very pretty, Monsieur Desvarennes, but I advise you to keep your flashes
      of wit to yourself,&rdquo; said Marechal, seriously. &ldquo;That may not suit
      everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marechal, you, too, making a fuss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And turning on his heel, he went to the refreshment table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince and Princess Panine were just coming in. Micheline was smiling, and
      Serge was pale, though calm. Cayrol and Jeanne came toward them. Everybody
      turned to look at them. Jeanne, without embarrassment, shook hands with
      her friend. Cayrol bowed respectfully to Micheline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Princess,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will you honor me by taking my arm? You are just in
      time, they are going to begin dancing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not myself, though, thank you,&rdquo; replied Micheline, with a sad smile, &ldquo;I
      am still very weak, but I will look on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And on Cayrol&rsquo;s arm she entered the large drawing-room. Serge followed
      with Jeanne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The festivities were at their height. The orchestra was playing a waltz,
      and in a whirl of silk and gauze the young people seemed to be thoroughly
      enjoying themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suzanne Herzog was sitting alone near a window, in a simple white dress,
      and without a single ornament. Marechal had just approached her, and she
      had welcomed him with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not dancing to-night, Mademoiselle?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am waiting to be invited,&rdquo; she answered, sadly, &ldquo;and, like sister Anne,
      I see nobody coming. There are ugly reports abroad about my father&rsquo;s
      fortune, and the Argonauts are drawing off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you give me a dance?&rdquo; said Marechal. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dance to perfection,
      never having practised much, but with a good will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Monsieur Marechal, I would rather talk. I am not very cheerful
      to-night, and, believe me, I only came because Madame Desvarennes wished
      it. I would rather have remained at home. Business has gone wrong with my
      father by what I can hear, for I don&rsquo;t know what goes on at the office. I
      feel more inclined to cry than to laugh. Not that I regret the loss of
      money, you know; I don&rsquo;t care for it, but my father must be in despair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marechal listened silently to Suzanne, not daring to tell her what he
      thought of Herzog, and respected the real ignorance or willing blindness
      of the young girl who did not doubt her father&rsquo;s loyalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess, leaning on Cayrol&rsquo;s arm, had just finished promenading round
      the rooms, when she perceived Suzanne and, leaving the banker, came and
      seated herself beside her. Many of the guests looked at each other and
      whispered words which Micheline did not hear, and if she had heard would
      not have understood. &ldquo;It is heroic!&rdquo; some said. Others answered, &ldquo;It is
      the height of impudence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Princess was talking with Suzanne and was looking at her husband who,
      leaning against a door, was following Jeanne with his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a sign from Cayrol, Marechal left the room. The secretary joined Madame
      Desvarennes, who had come with Pierre and had remained in Cayrol&rsquo;s private
      office. During this party matters of moment were to be discussed, and a
      consultation was about to take place between the interested parties. On
      seeing Marechal enter, Madame only uttered one word:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cayrol?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here he is,&rdquo; answered the secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol came in, hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he asked, with great anxiety, &ldquo;have you any news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pierre has just come from London,&rdquo; answered the mistress. &ldquo;What we feared
      is true. Herzog, conjointly with my son-in-law, has made use of the ten
      millions belonging to the European Credit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that Herzog has really bolted?&rdquo; inquired Marechal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! he is too deep for that,&rdquo; replied Cayrol. &ldquo;He will return. He knows
      that in compromising the Prince it is as if he had compromised the firm of
      Desvarennes, therefore he is quite easy on the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can the one be saved without the other?&rdquo; asked the mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible. Herzog has so firmly bound up his interests with those
      of the Prince that it will be necessary to extricate both or let both
      perish together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we must save Herzog into the bargain, then!&rdquo; said Madame
      Desvarennes, coldly. &ldquo;But by what means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These,&rdquo; answered Cayrol. &ldquo;The shares taken away by Herzog, under the
      security of the Prince&rsquo;s signature, were deposited by the shareholders.
      When the Universal Credit removed to its new offices, these shares were
      taken away by mistake. It will suffice to replace the scrip. I will give
      back the receipt to the Prince and all trace of this deplorable affair
      will be wiped out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the numbers of the shares will not be the same,&rdquo; said Madame
      Desvarennes, accustomed to minute regularity in all operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can explain the change by feigning a sale when they were high, and
      buying them up when low. We will show a profit, and the shareholders will
      not quarrel. Besides, I reserve the right of divulging Herzog&rsquo;s fraud
      without implicating Panine, if the shareholders insist. Trust me, I will
      catch Herzog another time. It is my stupid confidence in that man which
      has been partly the cause of this disaster. I will make your business mine
      and force him to shell out. I shall leave for London to-night, by the 1.50
      train. Promptness of action in such a case is the first step toward
      success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Cayrol,&rdquo; said the mistress. &ldquo;Have my daughter and the Prince
      arrived?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Serge is calm; he has more power over himself than I could have
      believed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it matter to him what is going on? Is it he who will feel the
      blow? No. He knows that I shall go on working to keep him in idleness and
      maintain him in luxury. I may think myself lucky if he is reclaimed by
      this hard lesson, and does not again begin to rummage in other people&rsquo;s
      safes, for then I should be unable to save him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mistress rose and, with flashing eyes, walked up and down the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the wretch!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If ever my daughter ceases to come between
      him and me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A terrible gesture finished the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol, Marechal, and Pierre looked at each other. The same thought came
      to their minds, dark and fearful. In a paroxysm of rage this fond mother,
      this energetic and passionate woman, would be capable of killing any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember what I told you one day,&rdquo; murmured Marechal, approaching
      Cayrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would prefer the hatred of ten men to that of such a woman,&rdquo; answered
      Cayrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cayrol!&rdquo; continued Madame Desvarennes, after a few moments of meditation,
      &ldquo;the conduct of the business of which you spoke to us a little while ago
      depends solely on you, does it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On me alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do it at once, then, cost me what it may. Has it been noised abroad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one has the slightest suspicion. I have not mentioned it to a living
      soul,&rdquo; said the banker&mdash;&ldquo;except to my wife,&rdquo; added he with a
      frankness which drew a smile from Pierre. &ldquo;But my wife and I are one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo; asked Madame Desvarenes, looking straight at Cayrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had been the person concerned,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she could not possibly
      have been more affected. She loves you so much, Madame, you and those
      belonging to you. She besought me to do all in my power to get the Prince
      out of this scrape. She had tears in her eyes: And, truly, if I did not
      feel bound to serve you from gratitude I would do it for her sake and to
      give her pleasure. I was touched, I can assure you. Really, she has a
      heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marechal exchanged a look with Madame Desvarennes, who advanced toward the
      banker, and shook him by the hand, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cayrol, you are truly a good man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Cayrol, smiling to hide his emotion, &ldquo;and you may rely
      upon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Micheline appeared on the threshold of the room. Through the half-open
      door the dancers could be seen passing to and fro, and the sound of music
      floated in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has become of you, mamma? I hear that you have been here for more
      than an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was talking on business matters with these gentlemen,&rdquo; answered Madame
      Desvarennes, smoothing from her brow the traces of her cares by an effort
      of will. &ldquo;But you, dear, how do you feel? Are you not tired?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more so than usual,&rdquo; replied Micheline, looking round to follow the
      movements of her husband, who was trying to reach Jeanne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you come to this party? It was unwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serge wished me to come, and I did not care to let him come without me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! dear me!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame Desvarennes. &ldquo;Let him do what he likes.
      Men are savages. When you are ill it won&rsquo;t hurt him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not ill, and I won&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; resumed Micheline, warmly. &ldquo;We are going
      away now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She motioned to Serge with her fan. Panine came to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will take me home, won&rsquo;t you, Serge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, dear one,&rdquo; answered Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne, who was listening at a distance, raised her hand to her forehead
      as a sign that she wanted him. A feeling of surprise came over the Prince,
      and he did not understand what she meant. Micheline had seen the sign. A
      deadly pallor spread over her features, and a cold perspiration broke out
      on her forehead. She felt so ill that she could have cried out. It was the
      first time she had seen Serge and Jeanne together since the dreadful
      discovery at Nice. She had avoided witnessing their meeting, feeling
      uncertain of herself, and fearing to lose her self-control. But seeing the
      two lovers before her, devouring each other with their looks, and making
      signs to each other, made her feel most terribly jealous and angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge had decided to obey the imperious signs which Jeanne made to him,
      and turning toward his wife, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember now, my dear, that before going home I must call at the club.
      I promised, and cannot put it off. Excuse my not going with you, and ask
      your mother to accompany you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Micheline, in a trembling voice. &ldquo;I will ask her. You
      are not going just yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, shall leave in a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young wife did not want to lose one detail of the horrible comedy
      being played under her very eyes. She remained to learn, unawares, the
      reason for which Jeanne kept her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not thinking that he was watched, Serge had gone across to Jeanne, and
      affecting a smile, inquired:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serious news.&rdquo; And she explained that she must speak to her lover that
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Serge asked, with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; answered Jeanne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your husband?&rdquo; the Prince said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is leaving in an hour. Our guests will not remain late. Go to the garden,
      and wait in the pavilion. The door of the back stairs leading to my
      dressing-room will be open. When everybody has gone, come up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care; we are observed,&rdquo; said Serge, uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they began to laugh with affectation and talked aloud about frivolous
      things, as if nothing serious were occupying their thoughts. Cayrol had
      come back again. He went up to Madame Desvarennes, who was talking with
      her daughter, and, full of business, thoughtlessly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will telegraph you as soon as I reach London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going away?&rdquo; inquired Micheline, a light dawning on her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cayrol; &ldquo;I have an important matter to settle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when do you start?&rdquo; continued Micheline, in such a changed voice that
      her mother was frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a moment,&rdquo; answered the banker. &ldquo;Allow me to leave you. I have several
      orders to give.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And leaving the boudoir, he regained the little drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Micheline, with clinched hands and fixed gaze, was saying to herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will be alone to-night, and has asked him to come to her. He told me
      an untruth about his having to go to the club. He is going to see her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And passing her hand across her brow, as if to drive away an unpleasant
      thought, the young wife remained silent, dismayed and crushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Micheline, what is the matter with you?&rdquo; asked Madame Desvarennes,
      seizing her daughter&rsquo;s hand, which was icy cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; stammered Micheline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are ill, I see. Come, let us go home. Come and kiss Jeanne&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; cried Micheline, with horror, instinctively recoiling as if dreading
      some impure contact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes became suddenly cold and calm. She foresaw a terrible
      revelation, and observing her daughter narrowly, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you cry out when I speak of your kissing Jeanne? Whatever is the
      matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Micheline grasped her mother&rsquo;s arm, and pointed to Serge and Jeanne, who
      were in the little drawing-room, laughing and talking, surrounded by a
      group of people, yet alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at them!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; exclaimed the mother in agony. She read the truth in
      her daughter&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know&mdash;&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he is her lover,&rdquo; cried Micheline, interrupting her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see
      that I am dying through it?&rdquo; she added, sobbing bitterly and falling into
      her mother&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mistress carried her as if she had been a child into Cayrol&rsquo;s private
      office, and shut the door. Then, kneeling beside the couch on which
      Micheline was stretched, she gave vent to her grief. She begged her
      daughter to speak to her, and warmed her hands with kisses; then, seeing
      her still cold and motionless, she was frightened, and wanted to call for
      help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; be quiet!&rdquo; murmured Micheline, recovering. &ldquo;Let no one know. I ought
      to have held my peace; but I have suffered so much I could not help
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My life is blasted, you see. Take me away; save me from this infamy!
      Jeanne, my sister, and Serge. Oh! make me forget it! For pity&rsquo;s sake,
      mamma, you who are so strong, you who have always done what you wished,
      take from my heart all the pain that is there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes, overcome by such a load of grief, lost command of
      herself, and, quite brokenhearted, began to cry and moan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God! Micheline, my poor child! you were suffering so and did not tell
      me. Oh! I knew you no longer trusted your old mother. And I stupidly did
      not guess it! I said to myself, at least she knows nothing about it, and
      sacrificed everything to keep the knowledge of their wrong-doing from you.
      Don&rsquo;t cry any more, darling, you will break my heart. I, who would have
      given up everything in the world to see you happy! Oh, I have loved you
      too much! How I am punished!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I who am punished,&rdquo; said Micheline, sobbing, &ldquo;for not obeying you.
      Ah! children ought always to heed their mother. She divines the danger. Is
      it not too horrible, mamma? I, who have sacrificed everything for him, to
      think that he does not love me, and never will love me! What will my life
      be without confidence, hope, or affection? I am too unhappy. It would be
      better to die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Die! you!&rdquo; cried her mother, whose eyes, wet with tears, dried in a
      moment, as if by an inward fire. &ldquo;Die! Come, don&rsquo;t talk such nonsense!
      Because a man treats you with scorn and betrays you? Are men worth dying
      for? No, you shall live, my darling, with your old mother. You shall have
      a deed of separation from your husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he will be free,&rdquo; exclaimed Micheline, angrily. &ldquo;He will go on loving
      her! Oh! I cannot bear that thought. Do you know, what I am going to tell
      you seems awful. I love him so much, that I would rather see him dead than
      unfaithful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes was struck, and remained silent. Serge dead! That idea
      had already occurred to her as a dream of deliverance. It came upon her
      peremptorily, violently, irresistibly. She repelled it with an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can never think of him but as vile and odious,&rdquo; continued Micheline.
      &ldquo;Every day his sin will seem more dastardly and his hypocrisy more base.
      There, a little while ago, he was smiling; and do you know why? Because
      Cayrol is going away, and during his absence Serge will return here
      tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I read it in his joyful looks. I love him. He cannot hide anything from
      me. A traitor to me, and a traitor toward his friend, that is the man whom&mdash;I
      am ashamed to own it&mdash;I love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Compose yourself! Someone is coming,&rdquo; said Madame Desvarennes, and at the
      same time the door opened and Jeanne appeared, followed by Marechal, who
      was anxious at their disappearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Micheline ill?&rdquo; inquired Madame Cayrol, coming forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it is nothing. Just a little fatigue,&rdquo; said Madame Desvarennes.
      &ldquo;Marechal, give my daughter your arm, and take her to her carriage. I
      shall be down in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And holding Jeanne by the hand to prevent her following Micheline, she
      added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay; I have something to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne looked surprised. Madame Desvarennes was silent for a moment. She
      was thinking about Serge coming there that night. She had only to say one
      word to Cayrol to prevent his going away. The life of this wretch was
      entirely in her hands then! But Jeanne! Was she going to ruin her? Had she
      the right thus to destroy one who had struggled and had defended herself?
      Would it be just? Jeanne had been led on against her will. She must
      question her. If the poor girl were suffering, if she repented, she must
      spare her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes, having thus made up her mind, turned toward Jeanne who
      was waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a long time since I have seen you, my dear, and I find you happy
      and smiling. It is the first time since your marriage that you have seemed
      so happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne looked at the mistress without answering. In these words she
      detected irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have found peace,&rdquo; continued Madame Desvarennes, looking steadfastly
      at Jeanne with her piercing eyes. &ldquo;You see, my dear, when you have a clear
      conscience&mdash;for you have nothing to reproach yourself with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne saw in this sentence a question and not an affirmation. She
      answered, boldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that I love you, and would be most lenient,&rdquo; continued Madame
      Desvarennes, sweetly, &ldquo;and that you might safely confide in me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to fear, having nothing to tell,&rdquo; said Jeanne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing?&rdquo; repeated the mistress, with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; affirmed Jeanne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes once more looked at her adopted daughter as if she
      would read her very soul. She found her quite calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then!&rdquo; said she, hastily walking toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going already?&rdquo; asked Jeanne, offering her brow to Madame
      Desvarennes&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, good-by!&rdquo; said the latter, with an icy kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne, without again turning round, went into the drawing-room. At the
      same moment, Cayrol, in a travelling-coat, entered the office, followed by
      Pierre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am, quite ready,&rdquo; said the banker to Madame Desvarennes. &ldquo;Have you
      any new suggestion to make to me, or anything else to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Madame Desvarennes, in a stern voice which made Cayrol
      start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then make haste. I have only a moment to spare, and you know the train
      waits for no one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol, in amazement, answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean it? Your interests are at stake yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your honor is in danger here,&rdquo; cried the mistress, vehemently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My honor!&rdquo; repeated Cayrol, starting back. &ldquo;Madame, do you know what you
      are saying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; answered Madame Desvarennes. &ldquo;And do you remember what I promised
      you? I undertook to warn you, myself, if ever the day came when you would
      be threatened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; questioned Cayrol, turning quite livid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I keep my promise. If you wish to know who your rival is, come home
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some inaudible words rattled in Cayrol&rsquo;s throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rival! in my house! Can Jeanne be guilty? Do you know, if it is true I
      will kill them both!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deal with them as your conscience dictates,&rdquo; said Madame Desvarennes. &ldquo;I
      have acted according to mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre, hitherto dumb with horror at the scene of which he had been a
      witness, shook off his stupor, and going up to Madame Desvarennes, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, do you know that what you have just done is frightful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? That man will be acting within his rights the same as I am. They are
      seeking to take away his wife, and they are killing my daughter, and
      dishonoring me! We are defending ourselves! Woe to those who are guilty of
      the crime!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol had fallen, as if thunderstruck, on a chair, with haggard eyes; his
      voice was gone, and he looked the image of despair. Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s
      words came back to him like the refrain of a hated song. To himself he
      kept repeating, without being able to chase away the one haunting thought:
      &ldquo;Her lover, to-night, at your house!&rdquo; He felt as if he were going mad. He
      was afraid he should not have time to wreak his vengeance. He made a
      terrible effort, and, moaning with grief, he arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; said Pierre. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol eyed Jeanne, who was approaching. Burning tears came to his eyes.
      He murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She, with a look so pure, and a face so calm! Is it possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded a farewell to Pierre and Madame Desvarennes, who were leaving,
      and recovering himself, advanced to meet Jeanne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you off?&rdquo; she inquired. &ldquo;You know you have no time to lose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol shuddered. She seemed anxious to get rid of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have still a few minutes to spend with you,&rdquo; he said, with emotion.
      &ldquo;You see, Jeanne, I am sad at going away alone. It is the first time I
      have left you. In a moment our guests will be gone&mdash;I beg of you,
      come with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne smiled. &ldquo;But you see, dear, I am in evening dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The night of our marriage I brought you away from Cernay like that. Wrap
      yourself up in your furs, and come! Give me this proof of affection. I
      deserve it. I am not a bad man&mdash;and I love you so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne frowned. This pressing vexed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is childish,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You will return the day after tomorrow, and
      I am tired. Have some pity for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You refuse?&rdquo; asked Cayrol, becoming gloomy and serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne touched his face slightly with her white hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! Don&rsquo;t leave me in a temper! You won&rsquo;t miss me much, you will sleep
      all the way. Good-by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol kissed her; in a choking voice, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne&rsquo;s face brightened, as she stood listening for a moment and heard
      the carriage which contained her husband rolling away. Uttering a sigh of
      relief, she murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX. THE CRISIS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jeanne had just taken off her ball-dress to put on a dressing-gown of
      Oriental cloth richly embroidered with silk flowers. Leaning her elbows on
      the mantelpiece, and breathing heavily, she was waiting. Her maid came in,
      bringing a second lamp. The additional light displayed the rich warm
      hangings of ruby plush embroidered in dull gold. The bed seemed one mass
      of lace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has everybody gone?&rdquo; asked Jeanne, pretending to yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messieurs Le Brede and Du Tremblay, the last guests, are just putting on
      their overcoats,&rdquo; answered the maid. &ldquo;But Monsieur Pierre Delarue has come
      back, and is asking whether Madame will speak with him for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Delarue?&rdquo; repeated Jeanne, with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he has something important to say to Madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; asked Jeanne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, in the gallery. The lights were being put out in the
      drawing-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, show him in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maid went out. Jeanne, much puzzled, asked herself, what could have
      brought Pierre back? It must certainly be something very important. She
      had always felt somewhat awed in Pierre&rsquo;s presence. At that moment the
      idea of being face to face with the young man was most distressing to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A curtain was lifted and Pierre appeared. He remained silent and confused
      at the entrance of the room, his courage had deserted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jeanne, with assumed stiffness, &ldquo;whatever is the matter, my
      friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter is, my dear Jeanne,&rdquo; began Pierre, &ldquo;that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the explanation did not seem so very easy to give, for he stopped and
      could not go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That?&rdquo; repeated Madame Cayrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; resumed Pierre. &ldquo;I am greatly embarrassed. In coming
      here I obeyed a sudden impulse. I did not think of the manner in which I
      should tell you what I have to say, and I see that I shall have to run a
      great risk of offending you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne assumed a haughty air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but, my dear friend, if what you have to say is so difficult, don&rsquo;t
      say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; retorted Pierre. &ldquo;My silence would cause irreparable
      mischief. In mercy, Jeanne, make my task easier! Meet me half way! You
      have projects for to-night which are known. Danger threatens you. Take
      care!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne shuddered. But controlling herself, she answered, laughing
      nervously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What rubbish are you talking about? I am at home, surrounded by my
      servants, and I have nothing to fear. I beg of you to believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You deny it!&rdquo; exclaimed Pierre. &ldquo;I expected as much. But you are only
      taking useless trouble. Come, Jeanne, I am the friend of your childhood;
      you have no reason to fear aught from me. I am only trying to be of use to
      you. You must know that, by my coming here, I know all. Jeanne, listen to
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo; interrupted the young woman, proudly, &ldquo;or are you taking
      part in some absurd joke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in my right mind, unfortunately for you!&rdquo; said Pierre, roughly,
      seeing that Jeanne refused to believe him. &ldquo;And there is no joke in the
      matter. Everything is true, serious and terrible! Since you compel me to
      say things which may be unpalatable, they must out. Prince Panine is in
      your house, or he soon will be. Your husband, whom you think far away, is
      within call, perhaps, and will come and take you unawares. Is not that a
      serious matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A frown overspread her face, and in an ungovernable rage she stepped
      forward, determined not to give in, and exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away! or I shall call for assistance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call, it would look bad!&rdquo; resumed Pierre, calmly. &ldquo;On the contrary,
      let the servants get out of the way, and get the Prince to go if he be
      here, or if he has not yet arrived, prevent his coming in. So long as I
      remain here you will dissimulate your fear and will not take any
      precautions. I will leave you, then. Adieu, Jeanne! Believe that I wished
      to render you a service, and be sure that when I have crossed the
      threshold of this door I shall have forgotten everything that I may have
      said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre bowed, and, lifting the heavy curtain which hid the door leading to
      the gallery, went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hardly gone when the opposite door opened, and Serge entered the
      room. The young woman rushed into his arms and whispered into his ear,
      with trembling lips:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serge, we are lost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was there,&rdquo; answered Panine. &ldquo;I heard all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; cried Jeanne, terrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away at once. To remain here a moment longer is an imprudence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, if I remain, what shall I say to Cayrol when he comes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband!&rdquo; said Serge, bitterly. &ldquo;He loves you, he will forgive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know; but then we two shall be separated for ever. Is that what you
      desire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what can I do?&rdquo; cried Serge, in despair. &ldquo;Everything around me is
      giving way! Fortune, which has been my one aim in life, is escaping from
      me. The family which I have scorned is forsaking me. The friendship which
      I have betrayed overwhelms me. There is nothing left to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my love, my devotion?&rdquo; exclaimed Jeanne, passionately. &ldquo;Do you think
      that I will leave you? We must go away. I asked you long ago. You
      resisted; the moment has now come. Be easy! Madame Desvarennes will pay
      and save your name. In exchange you will give her back her daughter. You
      don&rsquo;t care about her, because you love me. I am your real wife; she who
      ought to share your life. Well, I take back my rights. I pay for them with
      my honor. I break all ties which could hold me back. I am yours, Serge!
      Our sin and misfortune will bind us more closely than any laws could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think, that with me you will have to endure poverty, and, perhaps,
      misery,&rdquo; said the Prince, moved by the young woman&rsquo;s infatuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My love will make you forget everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not feel regret or remorse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, so long as you love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, then,&rdquo; said the Prince, taking Jeanne in his arms. &ldquo;And if life is
      too hard&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; added Jeanne, finishing the sentence with sparkling eyes, &ldquo;we will
      seek refuge together in death! Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge bolted the door, through which Pierre had passed, and which alone
      communicated with the other apartments. Then, taking his mistress by the
      hand, he went with her into the dressing-room. Jeanne threw a dark cloak
      round her shoulders, put a hat on her head, and without taking either
      money, jewels, lace, or, in fact, anything that she had received from
      Cayrol, they went down the little back stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very dark. Jeanne did not take a light, as she did not care to
      attract attention, so they had to feel every step of the way as quietly as
      possible, striving not to make the least noise, holding their breath, and
      with beating hearts. When they reached the bottom of the stairs, Jeanne
      stretched out her hand, and sought the handle of the door which opened
      into the courtyard. She turned it, but the door would not open. She
      pushed, but it did not give way. Jeanne uttered a low groan. Serge shook
      it vigorously, but it would not open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been fastened on the outside,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fastened?&rdquo; murmured Jeanne, seized with fear. &ldquo;Fastened, and by whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge did not answer. The idea that Cayrol had done it came to his mind at
      once. The husband lying in wait, had seen him enter, and to prevent his
      escaping from his vengeance had cut off all means of retreating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silently, they went upstairs again, into the room through the
      dressing-room. Jeanne took off her bonnet and cloak, and sank into an
      armchair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must get away!&rdquo; said Serge, with suppressed rage; and he walked toward
      the door of the gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! don&rsquo;t open that,&rdquo; cried Jeanne, excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a frightened look, she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if he were behind the door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment, as if Jeanne&rsquo;s voice had indeed evoked Cayrol, a heavy
      step was heard approaching along the gallery, a hand tried to open the
      bolted door. Serge and Jeanne remained motionless, waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jeanne!&rdquo; called the voice of Cayrol from the outside, sounding mournfully
      in the silence, &ldquo;Jeanne, open!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with his fist he knocked imperatively on the woodwork.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you are there! Open, I say!&rdquo; he cried, with increasing rage. &ldquo;If
      you don&rsquo;t open the door, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go! I beseech you!&rdquo; whispered Jeanne, in Panine&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Go downstairs
      again, and break open the door. You won&rsquo;t find any one there now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he has stationed some one there,&rdquo; answered Serge. &ldquo;Besides, I
      won&rsquo;t leave you here alone exposed to his violence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not alone. I can hear you talking!&rdquo; said Cayrol, beside himself.
      &ldquo;I shall break open this door!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The husband made a tremendous effort. Under the pressure of his heavy
      weight the lock gave way. With a bound he was in the middle of the room.
      Jeanne threw herself before him; she no longer trembled. Cayrol took
      another step and fixed his glaring eyes on the man whom he sought,
      uttering a fearful oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serge!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;I might have guessed it. It is not only money of which
      you are robbing me, you villain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Panine turned horribly pale, and advanced toward Cayrol, despite Jeanne,
      who was clinging to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t insult me; it is superfluous,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;My life belongs to you;
      you can take it. I shall be at your service whenever you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol burst into a fearful laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! a duel! Come! Am I a gentleman? I am a plebeian! a rustic! a cowherd!
      you know that! I have you now! I am going to smash you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked round the room as if seeking a weapon, and caught sight of the
      heavy fire-dogs. He caught up one with a cry of triumph, and, brandishing
      it like a club, rushed at Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      More rapid than he, Jeanne threw herself before her lover. She stretched
      out her arms, and with a sharp voice, and the look of a she-wolf defending
      her cubs,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep behind me,&rdquo; said she to Serge; &ldquo;he loves me and will not dare to
      strike!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol had stopped. At these words he uttered a loud cry: &ldquo;wretched woman!
      You first, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raising his weapon, he was about to strike, when his eyes met Jeanne&rsquo;s.
      The young woman was smiling, happy to die for her lover. Her pale face
      beamed from out her black hair with weird beauty. Cayrol trembled. That
      look which he had loved, would he never see it again? That rosy mouth,
      whose smile he cherished, would it be hushed in death? A thousand thoughts
      of happy days came to his mind. His arm fell. A bitter flood rushed from
      his heart to his eyes; the iron dropped heavily from his hand on to the
      floor, and the poor man, overcome, sobbing, and ashamed of his weakness,
      fell senseless on a couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne did not utter a word. By a sign she showed Serge the door, which
      was open, and with a swollen heart she leaned on the mantelpiece, waiting
      for the unfortunate man, from whom she had received such a deep and sad
      proof of love, to come back to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge had disappeared.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. &ldquo;WHEN ROGUES FALL OUT&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      The night seemed long to Madame Desvarennes. Agitated and feverish, she
      listened through the silence, expecting every moment to hear some fearful
      news. In fancy she saw Cayrol entering his wife&rsquo;s room like a madman,
      unawares. She seemed to hear a cry of rage, answered by a sigh of terror;
      then a double shot resounded, the room filled with smoke, and, struck down
      in their guilty love, Serge and Jeanne rolled in death, interlaced in each
      other&rsquo;s arms, like Paolo and Francesca de Rimini, those sad lovers of whom
      Dante tells us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hour after hour passed; not a sound disturbed the mansion. The Prince had
      not come in. Madame Desvarennes, unable to lie in bed, arose, and now and
      again, to pass the time, stole on tiptoe to her daughter&rsquo;s room.
      Micheline, thoroughly exhausted with fatigue and emotion, had fallen
      asleep on her pillow, which was wet with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bending over her, by the light of the lamp, the mistress gazed at
      Micheline&rsquo;s pale face, and a sigh rose to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is still young,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;she may begin life afresh. The
      remembrance of these sad days will be wiped out, and I shall see her
      revive and smile again. That wretch was nearly the death of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the image of Serge and Jeanne stretched beside each other in the room
      full of smoke came before her eyes again. She shook her head to chase the
      importunate vision away, and noiselessly regained her own apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day dawned pale and bleak. Madame Desvarennes opened her window and
      cooled her burning brow in the fresh morning air. The birds were awake,
      and were singing on the trees in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little, the distant sound of wheels rolling by was heard. The
      city was awakening from its sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes rang and asked for Marechal. The secretary appeared
      instantly. He, too, had shared the anxieties and fears of the mistress,
      and had risen early. Madame Desvarennes greeted him with a grateful smile.
      She felt that she was really loved by this good fellow, who understood her
      so thoroughly. She begged him to go to Cayrol&rsquo;s, and gain some
      information, without giving him further details, and she waited, walking
      up and down the room to calm the fever of her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      On leaving the house in the Rue Taitbout, Serge felt bewildered, not
      daring to go home, and unable to decide on any plan; yet feeling that it
      was necessary to fix on something without delay, he reached the club. The
      walk did him good, and restored his physical equilibrium. He was thankful
      to be alive after such a narrow escape. He went upstairs with a
      comparatively light step, and tossed his overcoat to a very sleepy footman
      who had risen to receive him. He went into the card-room. Baccarat was
      just finishing. It was three o&rsquo;clock in the morning. The appearance of the
      Prince lent the game a little fresh animation. Serge plunged into it as if
      it were a battle. Luck was on his side. In a short time he cleared the
      bank: a thousand louis. One by one the players retired. Panine, left
      alone, threw himself on a couch and slept for a few hours, but it was not
      a refreshing sleep. On the contrary, it made him feel more tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day servants disturbed him when they came in to sweep the rooms and
      open the windows. He went into the lavatory, and there bathed his face.
      When his ablutions were over he wrote a note to Jeanne, saying that he had
      reflected, and could not possibly let her go away with him. He implored
      her to do all in her power to forget him. He gave this letter to one of
      the messengers, and told him to give it into the hands of Madame Cayrol&rsquo;s
      maid, and to none other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The care of a woman and the worry of another household seemed unbearable
      to him. Besides, what could he do with Jeanne? The presence of his
      mistress would prevent his being able to go back to Micheline. And now he
      felt that his only hope of safety was in Micheline&rsquo;s love for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But first of all he must go and see if Herzog had returned, and ascertain
      the real facts of the position in regard to the Universal Credit Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herzog occupied a little house on the Boulevard Haussmann, which he had
      hired furnished from some Americans. The loud luxury of the Yankees had
      not frightened him. On the contrary, he held that the gay colors of the
      furniture and the glitter of the gilded cornices were bound to have a
      fascination for prospective shareholders. Suzanne had reserved a little
      corner for herself, modestly hung with muslin and furnished with simple
      taste, which was a great contrast to the loud appearance of the other part
      of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving, Serge found a stableman washing a victoria. Herzog had
      returned. The Prince quietly went up the steps, and had himself announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The financier was sitting in his study by the window, looking through the
      newspapers. When Serge entered he rose. The two men stood facing each
      other for a moment. The Prince was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it that you have kept me without news during your absence?&rdquo; asked
      he, harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied Herzog, calmly, &ldquo;the only news I had was not good
      news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least I should have known it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would the result of the operation have been different?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have led me like a child in this affair,&rdquo; Serge continued, becoming
      animated. &ldquo;I did not know where I was going. You made me promises, how
      have you kept them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I was able,&rdquo; quietly answered Herzog. &ldquo;Play has its chances. One seeks
      Austerlitz and finds Waterloo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; cried the Prince, angrily, &ldquo;the shares which you sold ought not to
      have gone out of your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believed that?&rdquo; retorted the financier, ironically. &ldquo;If they ought
      not to have gone out of my hands it was hardly worth while putting them
      into them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In short,&rdquo; said Panine, eager to find some responsible party on whom he
      could pour out all the bitterness of his misfortune, &ldquo;you took a mean
      advantage of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! I expected you to say that!&rdquo; returned Herzog, smiling. &ldquo;If the
      business had succeeded, you would have accepted your share of the spoil
      without any scruples, and would have felt ready to crown me. It has
      failed; you are trying to get out of the responsibility, and are on the
      point of treating me as if I were a swindler. Still, the affair would not
      have been more honest in the first instance than in the second, but
      success embellishes everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge looked hard at Herzog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there to prove,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;that this speculation, which brings
      ruin and loss to me, does not enrich you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ungrateful fellow!&rdquo; observed the financier, ironically, &ldquo;you suspect me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of having robbed me!&rdquo; cried Serge, in a rage. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herzog, for a moment, lost his temper and turned red in the face. He
      seized Panine violently by the arm, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gently, Prince; whatever insults you heap upon me must be shared by you.
      You are my partner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scoundrel!&rdquo; yelled Panine, exasperated at being held by Herzog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Personalities,&rdquo; said the financier, in a jesting tone. &ldquo;Then I take my
      leave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And loosing his hold of the Prince, he went toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge sprang after him, exclaiming:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not leave this room until you have given me the means of
      rectifying this disaster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us talk sensibly, as boon companions,&rdquo; said Herzog. &ldquo;I know of a
      marvellous move by which we can get out of the difficulty. Let us boldly
      call a general meeting. I will explain the thing, and amaze everybody. We
      shall get a vote of confidence for the past, with funds for the future. We
      shall be as white as snow, and the game is played. Are you in with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; replied the Prince, intensely disgusted. &ldquo;It does not suit me to
      do a yet more shameful thing in order to get out of this trouble. It is no
      use arguing further; we are lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only the weak allow themselves to be lost!&rdquo; exclaimed the financier. &ldquo;The
      strong defend themselves. You may give in if you like; I won&rsquo;t. Three
      times have I been ruined and three times have I risen again. My head is
      good! I am down now. I shall rise again, and when I am well off, and have
      a few millions to spare, I will settle old debts. Everybody will be
      astonished because they won&rsquo;t expect it, and I shall be more thought of
      than if I had paid up at the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you are not allowed to go free?&rdquo; asked Serge. &ldquo;What if they arrest
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be in Aix-la-Chapelle to-night,&rdquo; said Herzog. &ldquo;From there I shall
      treat with the shareholders of the Universal Credit. People judge things
      better at a distance. Are you coming with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Serge, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong. Fortune is capricious, and in six months we may be richer
      than we ever have been. But as you have decided, let me give you a piece
      of advice which will be worth the money you have lost. Confess all to your
      wife; she can get you out of this difficulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The financier held out a hand to Serge which he did not take.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! pride!&rdquo; murmured Herzog. &ldquo;After all it is your right&mdash;It is you
      who pay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without answering a word the Prince went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that same hour, Madame Desvarennes, tired by long waiting, was pacing
      up and down her little drawing-room. A door opened and Marechal, the
      long-looked for messenger, appeared. He had been to Cayrol&rsquo;s, but could
      not see him. The banker, who had shut himself up in his private office
      where he had worked all night, had given orders that no one should
      interrupt him. And as Madame Desvarennes seemed to have a question on her
      lips which she dared not utter, Marechal added that nothing unusual seemed
      to have happened at the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as the mistress was thanking her secretary, the great gate swung on
      its hinges, and a carriage rolled into the courtyard. Marechal flew to the
      window, and uttered one word,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cayrol!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes motioned to him to leave her, and the banker appeared
      on the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a glance the mistress saw the ravages which the terrible night he had
      passed through had caused. Yesterday, the banker was rosy, firm, and
      upright as an oak, now he was bent, and withered like an old man. His hair
      had become gray about the temples, as if scorched by his burning thoughts.
      He was only the shadow of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes advanced toward him, and in one word asked a world of
      questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol, gloomy and fierce, raised his eyes to the mistress, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he not come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he came. But I had not the necessary energy to kill him. I thought
      it was an easier matter to become a murderer. And you thought so too, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cayrol!&rdquo; cried Madame Desvarennes, shuddering, and troubled to find that
      she had been so easily understood by him whom she had armed on her behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The opportunity was a rare one, though,&rdquo; continued Cayrol, getting
      excited. &ldquo;Fancy; I found them together under my own roof. The law allowed
      me, if not the actual right to kill them, at least an excuse if I did so.
      Well, at the decisive moment, when I ought to have struck the blow, my
      heart failed me. He lives, and Jeanne loves him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get rid of him in another way,&rdquo; answered Cayrol. &ldquo;I had only two ways of
      killing him. One was to catch him in my own house, the other to call him
      out. My will failed me in the one case; my want of skill would fail me in
      the other. I will not fight Serge. Not because I fear death, for my life
      is blighted, and I don&rsquo;t value it; but if I were dead, Jeanne would belong
      to him, and I could not bear the thought of that even in death. I must
      separate them forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By forcing him to disappear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he refuse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol shook his head menacingly, and exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I defy him! If he resist, I will bring him before the assizes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; said Madame Desvarennes, going nearer to Cayrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I!&rdquo; answered the banker, with energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretched man! And my daughter?&rdquo; cried the mistress. &ldquo;Think well what you
      are saying! You would disgrace me and mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I not dishonored myself?&rdquo; asked Cayrol. &ldquo;Your son-in-law is a robber,
      who has defiled my home and robbed my safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An honest man does not seek to revenge himself after the manner you
      suggest,&rdquo; said the mistress, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An honest man defends himself as he can. I am not a knight. I am only a
      financier. Money is my weapon. The Prince has stolen from me. I will have
      him sentenced as a thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make out your account. I will pay it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you also pay me for my lost happiness?&rdquo; cried the banker,
      exasperated. &ldquo;Should I not rather have chosen to be ruined than be
      betrayed as I am? You can never repair the wrong he has done me. And then
      I am suffering so, I must have my revenge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! fool that you are,&rdquo; replied Madame Desvarennes. &ldquo;The guilty will not
      feel your blows, but the innocent. When my daughter and I are in despair
      will you be less unhappy! Oh! Cayrol, take heed that you lose not in
      dignity what you gain in revenge. The less one is respected by others the
      more one must respect one&rsquo;s self. Contempt and silence elevate the victim,
      while rage and hatred make him descend to the level of those who have
      outraged him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let people judge me as they please. I care only for myself! I am a vulgar
      soul, and have a low mind&mdash;anything you like. But the idea that that
      woman belongs to another drives me mad. I ought to hate her, but,
      notwithstanding everything, I cannot live without her. If she will come
      back to me I will forgive her. It is ignoble! I feel it, but it is too
      strong for me. I adore her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before that blind love Madame Desvarennes shuddered. She thought of
      Micheline who loved Serge as Cayrol loved Jeanne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose she chooses to go away with Serge,&rdquo; said the mistress to herself.
      In a moment she saw the house abandoned, Micheline and Serge in foreign
      lands, and she alone in the midst of her overthrown happiness, dying of
      sadness and regrets. She made a last effort to move Cayrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, must I appeal in vain? Can you forget that I was a sure and devoted
      friend to you, and that you owe your fortune to me? You are a good man and
      will not forget the past. You have been outraged and have the right of
      seeking revenge, but think that in carrying it out you will hurt two women
      who have never done you any harm. Be generous! Be just! Spare us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cayrol remained silent; his face did not relax. After a moment he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see how low I have fallen, by not yielding at once to your
      supplications! Friendship, gratitude, generosity, all the good feelings I
      had, have been consumed by this execrable love. There is nothing left but
      love for her. For her, I forget everything. I degrade and debase myself.
      And what is worse than all, is that I know all this and yet I cannot help
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miserable man!&rdquo; murmured the mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! most miserable,&rdquo; sobbed Cayrol, falling into an armchair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes approached him, and quietly placed her hand on his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cayrol, you are weeping? Then, forgive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The banker arose and, with lowering brow, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! my resolution is irrevocable. I wish to place a world between Jeanne
      and Serge. If he has not gone away by tonight my complaint will be lodged
      in the courts of justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes no longer persisted. She saw that the husband&rsquo;s heart
      was permanently closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well. I thank you for having warned me. You might have taken action
      without doing so. Good-by, Cayrol. I leave your conscience to judge
      between you and me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The banker bowed, and murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with a heavy step, almost tottering, he went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had risen, and lit up the trees in the garden. Nature seemed to be
      making holiday. The flowers perfumed the air, and in the deep blue sky
      swallows were flying to and fro. This earthly joy exasperated Madame
      Desvarennes. She would have liked the world to be in mourning. She closed
      the window hastily, and remained lost in her own reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      So everything was over! The great prosperity, the honor of the house,
      everything was foundering in a moment. Even her daughter might escape from
      her, and follow the infamous husband whom she adored in spite of his
      faults&mdash;perhaps because of his very faults&mdash;and might drag on a
      weary existence in a strange land, which would terminate in death.
    </p>
    <p>
      For that sweet and delicate child could not live without material comforts
      and mental ease, and her husband was doomed to go on from bad to worse,
      and would drag her down with him! The mistress pictured her daughter, that
      child whom she had brought up with the tenderest care, dying on a pallet,
      and the husband, odious to the last, refusing her admission to the room
      where Micheline was in agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fearful feeling of anger overcame her. Her motherly love gained the
      mastery, and in the silence of the room she roared out these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That shall not be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The opening of the door recalled her to her senses, and she rose. It was
      Marechal, greatly agitated. After Cayrol&rsquo;s arrival, not knowing what to
      do, he had gone to the Universal Credit Company, and there, to his
      astonishment, had found the offices closed. He had heard from the porter,
      one of those superb personages dressed in blue and red cloth, who were so
      important in the eyes of the shareholders, that the evening before, owing
      to the complaint of a director, the police had entered the offices, and
      taken the books away, and that the official seal had been placed on the
      doors. Marechal, much alarmed, had hastened back to Madame Desvarennes to
      apprise her of the fact. It was evidently necessary to take immediate
      steps to meet this new complication. Was this indeed the beginning of
      legal proceedings? And if so how would the Prince come out of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes listened to Marechal, without uttering a word. Events
      were hurrying on even quicker than she had dreaded. The fears of the
      interested shareholders outran even the hatred of Cayrol. What would the
      judges call Herzog&rsquo;s underhand dealings? Would it be embezzlement? Or
      forgery? Would they come and arrest the Prince at her house? The house of
      Desvarennes, which had never received a visit from a sheriff&rsquo;s officer,
      was it to be disgraced now by the presence of the police?
    </p>
    <p>
      The mistress, in that fatal hour, became herself again. The strong-minded
      woman of old reappeared. Marechal was more alarmed at this sudden vigor
      than he had been at her late depression. When he saw Madame Desvarennes
      going toward the door, he made an effort to detain her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going, Madame?&rdquo; he inquired, with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mistress gave him a look that terrified him, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to square accounts with the Prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, passing through the door leading to the little staircase, Madame
      Desvarennes went up to her son-in-law&rsquo;s rooms.

      CHAPTER XXII. THE MOTHER&rsquo;S REVENGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      On leaving Herzog, Serge had turned his steps toward the Rue
      Saint-Dominique. He had delayed the moment of going home as long as
      possible, but the streets were beginning to be crowded. He might meet some
      people of his acquaintance. He resolved to face what ever reception was
      awaiting him on the way, he was planning what course he should adopt to
      bring about a reconciliation with his redoubtable mother-in-law. He was no
      longer proud, but felt quite broken down. Only Madame Desvarennes could
      put him on his feet again; and, as cowardly in trouble as he had been
      insolent in prosperity, he accepted beforehand all that she might impose
      upon him; all, provided that she would cover him with her protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was frightened, not knowing how deep Herzog had led him in the mire.
      His moral sense had disappeared, but he had a vague instinct of the danger
      he had incurred. The financier&rsquo;s last words came to his mind: &ldquo;Confess all
      to your wife; she can get you out of this difficulty!&rdquo; He understood the
      meaning of them, and resolved to follow the advice. Micheline loved him.
      In appealing to her heart, deeply wounded as it was, he would have in her
      an ally, and he had long known that Madame Desvarennes could not oppose
      her daughter in anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered the house through the back garden gate, and regained his room
      without making the slightest noise. He dreaded meeting Madame Desvarennes
      before seeing Micheline. First he changed his attire; he had walked about
      Paris in evening clothes. Looking in the glass he was surprised at the
      alteration in his features. Was his beauty going too? What would become of
      him if he failed to please. And, like an actor who is about to play an
      important part, he paid great attention to the making up of his face. He
      wished once more to captivate his wife, as his safety depended on the
      impression he was about to make on her. At last, satisfied with himself,
      he tried to look smiling, and went to his wife&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Micheline was up.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sight of Serge she could not suppress an exclamation of surprise.
      It was a long time since he had discontinued these familiar visits. The
      presence of her beloved one in that room, which had seemed so empty when
      he was not there, made her feel happy, and she went to him with a smile,
      holding out her hand. Serge drew her gently toward him and kissed her
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up, already, dear child,&rdquo; said he, affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have scarcely slept,&rdquo; answered Micheline. &ldquo;I was so anxious. I sat up
      for you part of the night. I had left you without saying good-night. It
      was the first time it had occurred, and I wanted to beg your pardon. But
      you came in very late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Micheline, it is I who am ungrateful,&rdquo; interrupted Panine, making the
      young wife sit down beside him. &ldquo;It is I who must ask you to be
      indulgent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serge! I beg of you!&rdquo; said the young wife, taking both his hands. &ldquo;All is
      forgotten. I would not reproach you, I love you so much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Micheline&rsquo;s face beamed with joy, and tears filled her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are weeping,&rdquo; said Panine. &ldquo;Ah! I feel the weight of my wrongs toward
      you. I see how deserving you are of respect and affection. I feel
      unworthy, and would kneel before you to say how I regret all the anxieties
      I have caused you, and that my only desire in the future will be to make
      you forget them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! speak on! speak on!&rdquo; cried Micheline, with delight. &ldquo;What happiness
      to hear you say such sweet words! Open your heart to me! You know I would
      die to please you. If you have any anxieties or annoyances confide in me.
      I can relieve them. Who could resist me when you are in question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have none, Micheline,&rdquo; answered Serge, with the constrained manner of a
      man who is feigning. &ldquo;Nothing but the regret of not having lived more for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the future not in store for us?&rdquo; said the young wife, looking lovingly
      at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince shook his head, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can answer for the future?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Micheline came closer to her husband, not quite understanding what Serge
      meant, but her mind was on the alert, and in an alarmed tone, she resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What strange words you are uttering? Are we not both young? And, if you
      like, is there not much happiness in store for us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she clung to him. Serge turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, stay,&rdquo; she murmured, again putting her arms round him. &ldquo;You are so
      truly mine at this moment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Panine saw that the opportunity for confessing all had come. He was able
      to bring tears to his eyes, and went toward the window as if to hide his
      emotion. Micheline followed him, and, in an eager tone, continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I knew you were hiding something. You are unhappy or in pain;
      threatened perhaps? Ah! if you love me, tell me the truth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes! It is true, I am threatened. I am suffering and unhappy! But
      don&rsquo;t expect a confession from me. I should blush to make it. But, thank
      Heaven, if I cannot extricate myself from the difficulty in which I am
      placed through my own folly and imprudence&mdash;there is yet another way
      out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serge! you would kill yourself!&rdquo; cried Micheline, terrified at the
      gesture Panine had made. &ldquo;What would become of me then? But what is there
      that is so hard to explain? And to whom should it be said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To your mother,&rdquo; answered Serge, bowing his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my mother? Very well, I will go to her. Oh! don&rsquo;t fear anything. I can
      defend you, and to strike you she will first have to attack me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge put his arms round Micheline, and with a kiss, the hypocrite
      inspired her whom he entrusted with his safety with indomitable courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait for me here,&rdquo; added the young wife, and passing through the little
      drawing-room she reached the smoking-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She halted there a moment, out of breath and almost choked with emotion.
      The long expected day had arrived. Serge was coming back to her. She went
      on, and as she reached the door of the stair leading to her mother&rsquo;s
      rooms, she heard a light tap from without.
    </p>
    <p>
      Greatly astonished, she opened the door, and suddenly drew back, uttering
      an exclamation. A woman, thickly veiled, stood before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sight of Micheline the stranger seemed inclined to turn and fly.
      But overcome with jealousy, the young wife seized her by the arm, dragged
      off her veil, and recognizing her, exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jeanne!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Cayrol approached Micheline, and beseechingly stretched out her
      hands:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Micheline! don&rsquo;t think&mdash;I come&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue!&rdquo; cried Micheline. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me any lies! I know all!
      You are my husband&rsquo;s mistress!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crushed by such a stroke, Jeanne hid her face in her hands and moaned:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must really be bold,&rdquo; continued Micheline, in a furious tone, &ldquo;to
      seek him here, in my house, almost in my arms!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne drew herself up, blushing with shame and grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that love brings me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it then?&rdquo; asked Micheline, contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The knowledge of inevitable and pressing danger which threatens Serge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A danger! Of what kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Compromised by Herzog, he is at the mercy of my husband, who has sworn to
      ruin him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is his rival. If you could ruin me, would you not do it?&rdquo; said
      Jeanne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; retorted Micheline, passionately. &ldquo;Do you think I am going to worry
      about you? Serge is my first thought. You say you came to warn him. What
      must be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a moment&rsquo;s delay he must go away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A strange suspicion crossed Micheline&rsquo;s mind. She approached Jeanne, and
      looking earnestly at her, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must go away without delay, eh? And it is you, braving everything,
      without a thought of the trouble you leave behind you, who come to warn
      him? Ah! you mean to go with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne hesitated a moment. Then, boldly and impudently, defying and almost
      threatening the legitimate wife:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, I wish to! Enough of dissimulation! I love him!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Micheline, transfigured by passion, strong, and ready for a struggle,
      threw herself in Jeanne&rsquo;s way, with arms outstretched, as if to prevent
      her going to Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;try to take him from me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him from you!&rdquo; answered Jeanne, laughing like a mad woman. &ldquo;To whom
      does he most belong? To the woman who was as ignorant of his love as she
      was of his danger; who could do nothing toward his happiness, and can do
      nothing for his safety? Or to the mistress who has sacrificed her honor to
      please him and risks her safety to save him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! wretch!&rdquo; cried Micheline, &ldquo;to invoke your infamy as a right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which of us has taken him from the other?&rdquo; continued Jeanne, forgetting
      respect, modesty, everything. &ldquo;Do you know that he loved me before he
      married you? Do you know that he abandoned me for you&mdash;for your
      money, I should say? Now, do you wish to weigh what I have suffered with
      what you suffer? Shall we make out a balance-sheet of our tears? Then, you
      will be able to tell which of us he has loved more, and to whom he really
      belongs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Micheline had listened to this furious address almost in a state of
      stupor, and replied, vehemently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What matter who triumphs if his ruin is certain. Selfish creatures that
      we are, instead of disputing about his love, let us unite in saving him!
      You say he must go away! But flight is surely an admission of guilt&mdash;humiliation
      and obscurity in a strange land. And that is what you advise, because you
      hope to share that miserable existence with him. You are urging him on to
      dishonor. His fate is in the hands of a man who adores you, who would
      sacrifice everything for you, as I would for Serge, and yet you have not
      thrown yourself at his feet! You have not offered your life as the price
      of your lover&rsquo;s! And you say that you love him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; stammered Jeanne, distracted. &ldquo;You wish me to save him for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the cry of your heart?&rdquo; said Micheline, with crushing disdain.
      &ldquo;Well, see what I am ready to do. If, to remove your jealous fears, it is
      necessary to sacrifice myself, I swear to you that if Serge be saved, he
      shall be perfectly free, and I will never see him again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Micheline, chaste and calm, with hands raised to Heaven, seemed to grow
      taller and nobler. Jeanne, trembling and overpowered, looked at her rival
      with a painful effort, and murmured, softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would do more!&rdquo; said the lawful wife, bending before the mistress. &ldquo;I
      ought to hate you, and I kneel at your feet and beseech you to listen to
      me. Do what I ask you and I will forgive you and bless you. Do not
      hesitate! Follow me! Let us throw ourselves at the feet of him whom you
      have outraged. His generosity cannot be less than ours, and to us, who
      sacrifice our love, he will not be able to refuse to sacrifice his
      vengeance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This greatness and goodness awaked feelings in Jeanne&rsquo;s heart which she
      thought dead. She was silent for a moment and then her breast heaved with
      convulsive sobs, and she fell helpless into the arms which Micheline, full
      of pity, held out to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; moaned the unhappy woman. &ldquo;I am conquered. Your rights are
      sacred, and you have just made them still more so. Keep Serge: with you he
      will once more become honest and happy, because, if your love is not
      greater than mine, it is nobler and purer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two women went hand in hand to try to save the man whom they both
      adored.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time Serge remained in the little drawing-room enjoying the hope
      of returning peace. It was sweet to him, after the troubles he had gone
      through. He had not the slightest suspicion of the scene in the adjoining
      room between Jeanne and Micheline. The fond heroism of his wife and the
      self-denial of his mistress were unknown to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time was passing. At least an hour had sped since Micheline left him to go
      to her mother, and Serge was beginning to think that the interview was
      very long, when a light step made him tremble. It came from the gallery.
      He thought it was Micheline, and opening the door, he went to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew back disappointed, vexed, and anxious, when he found it was
      Pierre. The two men had never met alone since that terrible night at Nice.
      Panine assumed a bold demeanor, and returned Pierre&rsquo;s firm look. Steadying
      his voice, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! is it you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you not expecting me?&rdquo; answered Pierre whose harsh voice thrilled
      Serge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prince opened his mouth to speak, but Pierre, did not give him time.
      In stern and provoking accents, he continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made you a promise once; have you forgotten it? I have a good memory.
      You are a villain, and I come to chastise you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pierre!&rdquo; exclaimed the Prince, starting fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he suddenly calmed himself, and added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me! I will not listen to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have to, though! You are a source of trouble and shame to the
      family to which you have allied yourself, and as you have not the courage
      to kill yourself, I have come to help you. You must leave Paris to-night,
      or you will be arrested. We shall go together to Brussels and there we
      shall fight. If chance favors you, you will be at liberty to continue your
      infamies, but at any rate I shall have done my best to rid two unfortunate
      women of your presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mad!&rdquo; said Serge, sneeringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think so! And know that I am ready for any emergency. Come; must I
      strike you, to give you courage?&rdquo; growled Pierre, ready to suit the action
      to the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! take care!&rdquo; snarled Serge, with an evil look.
    </p>
    <p>
      And opening a drawer which was close to him, he took out a revolver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thief first, then murderer!&rdquo; said Pierre, with a terrible laugh. &ldquo;Come,
      let&rsquo;s see you do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he was going toward the Prince when the door opened, and Madame
      Desvarennes came forward. Placing her hand on Pierre&rsquo;s shoulder, she said,
      in that commanding tone which few could resist:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go; wait for me in my room. I wish it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pierre bowed, and, without answering, went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge had placed the pistol on the table and was waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have to talk over several matters,&rdquo; said Madame Desvarennes, gravely,
      &ldquo;and you know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Madame,&rdquo; answered Panine, sadly, &ldquo;and, believe me, no one judges my
      conduct more severely than I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mistress could not help looking surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said, with irony, &ldquo;I did not expect to find you in such a mood.
      You have not accustomed me to such humility and sweetness. You must be
      afraid, to have arrived at that stage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Prince appeared not to have understood the implied insult in his
      mother-in-law&rsquo;s words. One thing struck him, which was that she evidently
      did not expect to find him repentant and humbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Micheline must have told you,&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not seen my daughter,&rdquo; interrupted the mistress, sharply, as if to
      make him understand that he must depend solely upon himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ignorant that Micheline had met Jeanne on her way to her mother, and had
      gone to Cayrol, Serge thought he was abandoned by his only powerful ally.
      He saw that he was lost and that his feigned resignation was useless.
      Unable to control himself any longer, his face darkened with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She, too, against me! Well! I will defend myself alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning toward Madame Desvarennes, he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To begin with, what do you want with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to ask you a question. We business folk when we fail, and cannot
      pay our way, throw blood on the blot and it disappears. You members of the
      nobility, when you are disgraced, how do you manage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am not mistaken, Madame,&rdquo; answered the Prince, in a light tone, &ldquo;you
      do me the favor of asking what my intentions are for the future? I will
      answer you with precision. I purpose leaving to-night for Aix-la-Chapelle,
      where I shall join my friend Herzog. We shall begin our business again. My
      wife, on whose good feelings I rely, will accompany me, notwithstanding
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in these last words he put all the venom of his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter will not leave me!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame Desvarennes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then, you can accompany her,&rdquo; retorted Panine. &ldquo;That
      arrangement will suit me. Since my troubles I have learned to appreciate
      domestic happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you hope to play your old games on me,&rdquo; said Madame Desvarennes. &ldquo;You
      won&rsquo;t get much out of me. My daughter and I with you&mdash;in the stream
      where you are going to sink? Never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; cried Panine, &ldquo;what do you expect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A violent ring at the front door resounded as Madame Desvarennes was about
      to answer, and stopped the words on her lips. This signal, which was used
      only on important occasions, sounded to Madame like a funeral knell. Serge
      frowned, and instinctively moved back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marechal appeared through the half-open door with a scared face, and
      silently handed Madame Desvarennes a card. She glanced at it, turned pale,
      and said to the secretary:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, let him wait!&rdquo; She threw the card on the table. Serge came
      forward and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delbarre, sheriff&rsquo;s officer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Haggard-looking and aghast, he turned to the mistress, as if seeking an
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she observed: &ldquo;it is clear, he has come to arrest you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Serge rushed to a cabinet, and opening a drawer, took forth some handfuls
      of gold and notes, which he crammed into his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the back stairs I shall have time to get away. It is my last chance!
      Keep the man for five minutes only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if the door is guarded?&rdquo; asked Madame Desvarennes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serge remained abject before her. He felt himself enclosed in a ring which
      he could not break through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One may be prosecuted without being condemned,&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;You will use
      your influence, I know, and you will get me out of this mess. I shall be
      grateful to you for ever, and will do anything you like! But don&rsquo;t leave
      me, it would be cowardly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He trembled, as he thus besought her distractedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The son-in-law of Madame Desvarennes does not go before the Assize Courts
      even to be acquitted,&rdquo; said she, with a firm voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you have me do?&rdquo; cried Serge, passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes did not answer, but pointed to the revolver on the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill myself? Ah! no; that would be giving you too much pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he gave the weapon a push, so that it rolled close to Madame
      Desvarennes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! wretch!&rdquo; cried she, giving way to her suppressed rage. &ldquo;You are not
      even a Panine! The Panines knew how to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not time to act a melodrama with you,&rdquo; snarled Serge. &ldquo;I am going
      to try to save myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he took a step toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mistress seized the revolver, and threw herself before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not go out!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo; he exclaimed, gnashing his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not go out!&rdquo; repeated the mistress, with flashing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with a strong arm he seized Madame Desvarennes, and threw her aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mistress became livid. Serge had his hand on the handle of the door.
      He was about to escape. Madame Desvarennes&rsquo;s arm was stretched forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shot made the windows rattle; the weapon fell from her hand, having done
      its work and, amid the smoke, a body dropped heavily on the carpet, which
      was soon dyed with blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment, the door opened, and Micheline entered, holding in her
      hand the fatal receipt which she had just wrung from Cayrol. The young
      wife uttered a heartrending cry, and fell senseless on Serge&rsquo;s body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind Micheline came the officer and Marechal. The secretary exchanged
      looks with the mistress, who was lifting her fainting daughter and
      clasping her in her arms. He understood all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning toward his companion, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! sir, here is a sad matter! The Prince, on hearing that you had
      come, took fright, although his fault was not very serious, and has shot
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The officer bowed respectfully to the mistress, who was bending over
      Micheline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please to withdraw, Madame. You have already suffered too much,&rdquo; said he.
      &ldquo;I understand your legitimate grief. If I need any information, this
      gentleman will give it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Desvarennes arose, and, without bending under the burden, she bore
      away on her bosom her daughter, regained.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
